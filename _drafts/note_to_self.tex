I glance at you, at a distance, the universal whole within you---a quiet
universal. For all within you is quiet---all barren and unspoken. The whole of the
unspoken---a zero-dimensional space---a contradiction as true
as these bones and shoes and ravens---the Great Unspoken. What
potent potion was it, by virtue of whose foulness all these stars---all these
souls--- were then begotten? Oh, yes, it was at night: a fathering wolf
devoured and it swelled. Life-pebbles scattered everywhere---this life which is
tonight was scattered. And you wished its extinction---you yearned a cave to
swallow and obscure---but it is never dark here in this sky---the fire-seeds
that scattered were ingrained thereon forever. Oh, yes, it was at night: and in
silence you unspoke the words that meant to say the truth---the first truth of
your soul.
