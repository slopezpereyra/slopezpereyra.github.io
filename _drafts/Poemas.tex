\subsection{I}

   there is a truth we cannot bear

   oh, all the drowning men have seen it

   their foaming eyes have almost touched it 

   in all their hearts it was a ruby 

   it was a moon as red as sunset's dying zest

   ~ ~ ~ 

   if you have walked, a shadow of your shadow,
   
   a ghost quadruped, primitive, not feral still, but close---

   if you have listened to the beggar's begging

   when sitting in your bed at night, alone--- 

   if you have heard a whisper cry 
   
   a piece of bread, for love of god...!

   and turned to see the darkness in your room---

   ~ ~ ~ 

   if you have loved I mean, a love outcasted, caged,

   then yes, you know the truth we cannot bear 

   you know there is a sea of drowning men 

   and in your heart there is a ruby 

   a violent moon you can't give up

   however much its weight may search the kiss 

   of sandless abysses of time

   \subsection{II}

How much I wish to find you, pecisely you who were the one who took me. Do you
recall the secret which was my offering to you? Remember you how young the
dreams I dreamt, how pure the shyness of my eyes: Remember now how well it stood 
the truth there dripping from my lips. Now I have learnt: Love drowns, it
always drowns---the flow of life is irresistible---nothing is true but for a
day.

Once you said to me: \textit{I will never leave you.} Strawberries were everywhere,
the moon was shining clear---Your face was that of early youth. But you have failed to 
love me---and who's to blame? You knew the secrets of my soul: You failed to love them.
You knew the uglyness of me: You failed to love it. You knew I could be foul and ruin:
You failed to love that.

To love is to uphold the entirety of a being, as if it was a final offering,
the one and only sacrifice which could bargain the forgiveness of our god.
You loved my poetry and my music;
you loved my brain and books; you loved my singing and my laughter; you loved
the color of my voice. You could not love my silly ways; you could not love the
sadness of my heart; you could not love the way eternity distracted me; you never
saw how deep a well my sorrows are. You'll never know how deep my sorrow is.

And why, O why? Why make me hope that we should live a life together, when you
were quick to turn your heart away? I wish I'd never known you. I wish to die 
a quiet death. I wish so many things, but not oblivion---no. I shall remember.
I must remember you so as to live the life which gives the memory of you.
