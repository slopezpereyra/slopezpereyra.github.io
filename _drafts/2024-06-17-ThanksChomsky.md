Fake news spread to day that Chomsky passed away. 


Comparable to Russell in  his
capacity to achieve both  depth  and  breadth,  his  intellectual  contributions
surpass    that    of    any    other    figure    in    the    last    century.
That aside, he was a humane, compassionate, and kind man. The passions which
ruled his life were the noble passions of humankind: knowledge, pity, and love.
It was through his lectures that transitioned from an interest in the philosophy
of mind to an interest in neuroscience. I owe him many things, those rare things
that one owns to the authors which have long been dead and which fill our hearts
and minds with inquisitive zeal—those very things I owe to Montaigne, to Borges,
and to Russell. Except—this marked a difference, though I did not know—he was alive.
My heart rejoiced in a secret comfort which it now reveals to me: A man like
Chomsky walks this earth—a soul this pure, somewhere, exists. This comfort is 
now gone. I pay my honors.
