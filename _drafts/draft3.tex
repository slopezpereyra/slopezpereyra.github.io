The conservative tradition generally draws its own roots to the philosophers of
the Enlightenment. Conversely, much of the mainstream left ---both in its
post-modern identitarian form as well as its more classical branches---
disregards the Enlightenment as either little more than the intellectual
stream of a primitive bourgeoisie ---a claim sustained sometimes by sophisticated
reasons--- or as the now hegemonic ideology of white and western men. But I have
come to suspect both conservatives and progressives alike are wrong in this
regard. A sincere examination of Enlightened thought leads to an unambiguous
conclusion on the matter: namely, that the very men who are esteemed to be the
intellectual guardians of liberal order would be petrified of horror if alive to
witness modern capitalism. Furthermore, so many common principles become apparent
between these philosophers and those of the most various socialist traditions
---from Marxist to anarchist thought--- that it is impossible to disregard the
hypothesis that they are, taken abstractly, almost identical, and that whichever
differences exist result merely of the application of unvarying principles to
distinct realities.

The common discourse puts classical liberalism as opposing the autocratic
power of the European monarchies of the early modern period. But this is only
partially true. In truth, the philosophers of the Enlightenment were opposed to
\textit{concentrated power}. It is a historical contingency that such
concentration occurred at the time in the court, but it is short-sighted---to
say the least---to abandon such position from the moment monarchies fell and
onwards.

Take, for example, Rousseau's \textit{Discourse on the origin and basis of
Inequality among Men}. Should anyone had access to the content of the book while
being somehow unaware of who his author was, he would surely guess to say the treatise
was the work of a utopian socialist or an early libertarian thinker. Such guess
would be justified for many different reasons, of which only a few I should wish
to discuss here. 

For example, take Rousseau's conception of the nature of men. Such conception is
usually said to be that men is good by nature, but although this is---in fact
textually---his claim, it misses to convey the subtlety of the whole
idea which the phrase summarizes. The natural men Rousseau is talking about is
a pure individual that has not yet entered a social arrangement, that is good
because, lacking any moral capacity, it wishes nor does anything else but that
which secures his existence or pleasure.
