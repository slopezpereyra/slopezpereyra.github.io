Do you recall the secret which was my offering to you?
Remember you how young the dreams I dreamt, how pure the
shyness of my eyes: Remember now how well it stood the truth
there dripping from my lips. Now I have learnt: Love drowns, it
always drowns—the flow of life is irresistible—nothing is
true but for a day.

Once you said to me: *I will never leave you.*
Strawberries were everywhere, the moon was shining clear—Your
face was that of early youth. But you have failed to love
me—and who's to blame? You knew the secrets of my soul: You
failed to love them. You knew the uglyness of me: You failed to
love it. You knew I could be foul and ruin: You failed to love
that.

To love is to uphold the entirety of a being, as if it was a
final offering, the one and only sacrifice which could bargain
the forgiveness of our god. You loved my poetry and my music;
you loved my brain and books; you loved my singing and my
laughter; you loved the color of my voice. You could not love
my silly ways; you could not love the sadness of my heart; you
could not love the way eternity distracted me; you never saw
how deep a well my sorrows are. You'll never know how deep my
sorrow is.

And why, O why? Why make me hope that we should live a life
together, when you were quick to turn your heart away? I wish
I'd never known you. I wish to die a quiet death. I wish so
many things, but not oblivion—no. I shall remember. I must
remember you, so as to live the life which gives the memory of
you.
