title: Here as we timeless lay 
categories: [ Poesía ]

here as we timeless lay presume that all is timeless<br>
that each new life is but an instant’s way<br>
and this ungotten child we have prefigured in a dream<br>
already bears the guilt of humankind<br>

yes, in the birth of each new drop of life<br>
await the seeds of all that is unfading<br>

you’ll see as I see now that you have been<br>
a wife to me as you were the wife of Abraham<br>
and that our child awaited in the rose<br>
that some forgotten eyes saw rise and fall amid the snow<br>
