I wish to give the windings of the moon to you<br>
the blunt interrogation of the dawn<br>
mercilessly posed before the soul of men<br>

the streets unwalked the libraries<br>
a page randomly taken—violently taken from a secret book<br>
and mysticism and dew<br>

I desire to offer all that I’ve never possessed<br>
but in what I live ungotten to you<br>

the locust-stricken regions of a tree<br>
the unsuspected darkness of the rose<br>
the never solitary loneliness of me<br>
under a winter-rain someday perhaps maybe<br>

I wish to offer silence<br>
dead and weary silence to you<br>

and that is all I am to offer to you<br>

this is the eternal water of generous cosmologies<br>
the stars reflected clear, as well eternal, in the water<br>
the silence of a dreaming child—these are my offerings to you<br>

this I confess before the night amidst the speeches of the water:<br>
that time the sands of time the cruelty of time I give to you<br>

this I confess before the moon that evil star:<br>
I longingly pursue all that which may evoke you<br>
hidden under a cloak of almost ethereal gloom <br>
as sweet as drizzly childish dawns <br>
only to think of you with unspeakable delight<br>

before you I extend this sort of death<br>
that rises from the heart unto the lips<br>

I seek in every rose the ceasing of the rose<br>
and in a whispering zest<br>
I speak your name I speak<br>
the vicious letters of your earthly name<br>
