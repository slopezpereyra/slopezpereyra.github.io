title: My Ubuntu setup
categories: [ Personal, Science ]

A good way of spending one's non-working time is investing in improving the
environment in which we work. Computer scientists work, unsurprisingly, with
computers, and most of them satisfy one of the necessary, albeit not sufficient
conditions for being a decent human being: using Linux.

Many of my fellow students find my Ubuntu setup interesting, sometimes even
pretty. It is Sunday today and I am sick, which means I have both free time and
a total lack of predisposition for anything which requires leaving bed. Thus, I
have decided to upen up my own little chamber of secrets, and reveal to thou
laymen of the world the source of my powers.

Some of the features I include:

- Live transparency adjustment.

# Fundamental principles

Some people spend *way* too much time tuning their operating systems than they
should. I venture that nothing but ill principles compels them to do so. The
time invested by some friends of mine to "ricing" ther Linux system must amount
to at least two readings of the *Divine Comedy*. So what the hell are they
doing?

To avoid this, one must keep in mind the following:

- Choosing a color palette is important, and Ubuntu's color palette is
  beautiful. Hence, there is no need to spend any time on this decision.
- Nothing is more important than the window manager, and i3 is the superior one.
- Adding features doesn't improve your OS. Keep it simple.
