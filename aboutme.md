I am a computer science student. My current goal is to pursue a PhD in
computational neuroscience. I work as a research assistant at a neuroscience
lab in UPenn. At the lab, I was given the liberty to propose and research a
novel mathematical model of intracortical inhibition/facilitation and its
predictive power using random forests. I have presented this research at the
SLEEP 2024 conference. I am also the developer of a main [Julia library](https://slopezpereyra.github.io/EEGToolkit.jl/dev/) for EEG analysis. 

My intellectual life, however, is hardly limited to neuroscience or computer
science. Originally, I wanted to major in philosophy, to the study of which I
devoted my teenage years. It was only at eighteen years of age that,
upon discovering the work of Bertrand Russell, and subsequently that of Frege,
I became interested in mathematics and formal logics. These interests, combined
with my taste for the philosophy of mind, are what evolved into a passion for
computer science and, particularly, its application to neuroscience.

I also write (very questionable) poetry, though without an interest in
publishing. Despite what became my professional destiny, I like to think I am a
literary man more than a scientific one, and poetry was always my favorite form
of literature. I also play the classical guitar, an instrument I studied from
age nine to seventeen.

This blog is not a professional blog. It is an attempt at building a shrine to
all those which I hold to be the dearest things of life.
