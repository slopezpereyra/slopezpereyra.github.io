I am a computer science student. My current goal is to pursue a PhD in
computational neuroscience. I work as a data scientist and research assistant at
a neuroscience lab in UPenn. Aside from mere assistance and customary data
science tasks, I have conducted research on a mathematical model of
neuroplasticity. 

My intellectual life, however, is hardly limited to neuroscience. Originally, I
wanted to major in philosophy, to the study of which I devoted most of my
teenage years. It was only at eighteen years of age that, upon discovering the
work of Bertrand Russell, and subsequently that of Frege, I became
interested in mathematics and formal logics. These interests, combined with my
taste for the philosophy of mind, evolved into a passion for computer science
and, particularly, its application to neuroscience.

I also write (very questionable) poetry, though without an interest in
publishing. Despite what became my professional destiny, I like to think I am
a literary man more than a scientific one, and poetry was always my favorite
form of literature. I also play the classical guitar, an instrument I studied
from age nine to seventeen.

With so varying interests, I found it difficult as a young student to
choose a career path. I did not know whether I wanted to be a poet, a
philosopher, a mathematician, or a scientist. The process by virtue of which
science got the upper hand is hardly transparent even to myself—however badly
that may sound. But I love scientific work—and remain in love with all those
things I once considered devoting my life to.

This blog is not a professional blog. It is an attempt at building a shrine to
all those which I hold to be the dearest things of life.
