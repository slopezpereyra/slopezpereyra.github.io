## About me
<div style="text-align: justify">
My name is Nitin Singh. I am currently employed as Data Science Researcher at Shell Technology Centre, 
Bangalore (India) within Data Science Research and Development team, where I am working on projects involving 
numerical optimization and machine learning. I posses expertise and share interests in the field of numerical 
and evolutionary optimization and general topics in machine learning. I am passionate about the capabilities
of Artificial Intelligence in automated control and power of data to reveal hidden and lesser understood
underlying trends.

Apart from this, I am also very inclined towards building a sustainable future that is more and more driven by green energy 
wherever possible. I find the idea of green energy driven future motivating and I look forward to make a meaningful 
contribution towards this through my skills.

Prior to joining Shell, I did my PhD research as part of a programme co-funded by Shell Global Solutions B.V, in 
the field of Computational Physics, working at AMOLF, Amsterdam and Leiden University. Specifically, my 
research focused on applying evolution-inspired optimisation algorithms and numerical computing techniques for 
rationally designing mechanical metamaterials - an emerging branch of futuristic materials. As a synopsis of the 
project, it involved - optimisation problem formulation, model-deployment on computer, large volume data retrieval 
and cleaning, and finally analysis and visualisation.
