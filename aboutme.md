## About me
<div style="text-align: justify">

Hello! 

It would certainly be misleading to being this with the universal form: I am an
$x$ currently employed at $y$, etc. For the very purpose of this blog is to serve as
a unifying point for the most various of my interests, from literature to
mathematics. Since some —though certainly not most— of the entries will relate
to my field, I am however forced to comply to the canonical standards.

I am a data scientist —whatever that means—, currently working at a
neuroscience laboratory in UPenn. I entered the world of data science late in my
studies of computer science, and curiously via readings concerning formal
epistemology —a fact from which you may deduce my interest for philosophy. I
still sustain that its philosophical implications are the most intriguing aspect of data
science. 

A brief description of my intellectual development might go as follows.
Originally, I wanted to major in philosophy. Relatively late, at eighteen, I
discovered the work of Bertrand Russell, which on its turn pointed me to Frege.
From this came a profound interest in logic and mathematics, which combined with
my commitment to the philosophy of mind evolved into a passion for computer
science. During the course of this process, there was not a single period in
which I did not enjoy and (tried to) produce literature —particularly poetry.

With so varying interests, I found it very difficult to chose a career path. I
did not know whether I wanted to be a poet, a philosopher, a mathematician, or a
scientist. The process by virtue of which I came to do what I do is hardly
transparent even to myself —however badly that may sound. But I do love what I
do —and I still love all those things I once considered devoting my life to. In
short, this blog is an attempt to building a humble shrine to all that which I
hold to be the dearest things of life.
