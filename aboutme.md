The standard universal form —I am an $x$ currently employed at $y$, etc—would be
misleading. The purpose of this site is to serve as a unifying point for the
most various of my interests. However, some of the do relate to my field, so I
may comply with the canonical standards.

I am a computer science student. My goal is to pursue a PhD at computational
neuroscience. I work as data scientist—whatever that means— at a neuroscience
laboratory in UPenn. I have conducted research on this lab—specifically on
mathematical models of neuroplasticity for TMS data—, aside from more routinary
data science tasks.

A brief description of my intellectual development might go as follows.
Originally, I wanted to major in philosophy, to the study of which I devoted
most of my teenage years. At eighteen, I discovered the work of Bertrand
Russell, which on its turn pointed me to Frege. From this came a profound
interest in logics and mathematics, which, combined with my commitment to the
philosophy of mind, evolved into a passion for computer science. During the whole
course of this process, I also wrote (very questionable) poetry and studied
classical guitar—an instrument I play since the age of nine.

With so varying interests, I found it difficult as a young student to
choose a career path. I did not know whether I wanted to be a poet, a
philosopher, a mathematician, or a scientist. The process by virtue of which
science got the upper hand is hardly transparent even to myself—however badly
that may sound. But I love scientific work—and remain in love with all those
things I once considered devoting my life to.

This blog is not a professional blog. It is an attempt at building a shrine to
all those which I hold to be the dearest things of life.
