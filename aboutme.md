I am a computer science student. My current goal is to pursue a PhD in
computational neuroscience. I work as a research assistant at a neuroscience
lab in UPenn. At the lab, I was given the liberty to propose and research a
novel mathematical model of intracortical inhibition/facilitation and its
potential to predicte depression and slow-wave sleep deprivation using random
forests. I have presented this research at the SLEEP 2024 conference, held in
Houston, Texas. I am also the developer and maintainer of an official [Julia
package](https://slopezpereyra.github.io/EEGToolkit.jl/dev/) for EEG analysis.

My intellectual life, however, is hardly limited to neuroscience or computer
science. Originally, I wanted to major in philosophy, to the study of which I
devoted my teenage years. It was only at eighteen years of age that, upon
discovering the work of Bertrand Russell, and subsequently that of Frege, I
became interested in mathematics and formal logics. These interests, combined
with my taste for the philosophy of mind, are what evolved into a passion for
computer science and, particularly, its application to neuroscience.

I am also a (questionable) writer and musician. Despite what became my
professional destiny, I like to think I am a literary man more than a scientific
one.

This blog is not a professional blog. It is an attempt at building a shrine to
all those which I hold to be the dearest things of life.
