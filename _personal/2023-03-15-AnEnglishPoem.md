##### An English Poem 

> To the memory of one I loved and lives no more.
---

Here in the night below the moon <br> 
I’ve cried that love is vain, and every word <br>
we whisper to our lover’s ears is wind forever gone.<br> 
But no love goes to waste, I now suspect— <br> 
my eyes glow with the light of every orb<br> 
that on this ancient sky has ever slept<br> 
as I pronounce with weakened words the truth.<br> 
O, no love goes to waste, I do not doubt;<br> 
it is forever kept away from us, cruel passing dust,<br> 
warm in the heart of those who never knew<br> 
nor will know that our whispers never died.<br> 
And as we slowly fade into the baleful mist,<br> 
you stranger have to know you’ll light your way<br>
if you remember this I say, not fool nor wise: <br>
that no love goes to waste, no memory dies.
