Writing is not to me entirely voluntary. I write not about the things I
know, for these could hardly fill a page or two, but of the things I
happen to be pondering about. More often than not, the query is not
*what is it* but *who am I*, and whatever I say is not as much a
statement about the world as a declaration of sentiment.

On mathematics, I lack any form of special talent, except a powerful
tendency to be gripped and become obsessed by certain problems; and
anyone who reads what I have written on it will find that I was merely
taking notes—and not profound ones. The truest of the things I write
is poetry, which is the single mode of expression, among those which I
practice, that is honest about the fact that it pretends nothing but to
release the soul from its burdens. In fact, the force which drives me to
consider any matter, and to write any single page, is the same force
which drives the artist: Catharsis.

For instance, a few days ago I happened to ask myself: What is the
number of connected graphs of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. The question
was asked with innocence: the matter was not innocent at all. A state of
restlessness took possession of me. I did not choose to pursue the
question: I desired to restore spiritual equilibrium. And thus I thought
about it, and thus I wrote about it, until satisfaction was reached.

Similarly, an intuition may seize control of my heart. I do not know
exactly what it is, so I begin the quest for words which could describe
it. A poem comes to be, but not because I wanted it. It feels as if he
claimed himself through me.

I read out of pleasure and without much of a commitment to retain what I
read, so the opinions of men greater than myself are often lost to me.
If a book is not compelling to me I disregard it, regardless of the
authority of his author, and I do not mind the fact that I make my
limitations evident in failing to appreciate a man of greater fame than
me. I often recall the lesser rather than the central aspects of a work,
and an occasional curiosity can captivate me more than the solid gist of
a deep argument. Above all, I despise grandiloquent or convoluted works,
and feel no shame in saying that I saw nothing to enjoy—nor even to
comprehend— in the likes of a Hegel or a Heidgger, however deep they
are claimed to be. I pursue matters with candour and joy, and thus
clarity and honesty compel me above all things.

The authors which I read are friends to me, more than authorities. I
tend to admire their intelligence just as much as their personal
qualities. I'm interested in their lives and in their works, and find it
hard to appreciate an author whom I wouldn't take as friend.
Like Quevedo, who said

> vivo en conversación con los difuntos,
>
> y escucho con mis ojos a los muertos.

I converse with them in my mind and, rather often, in my dreams. I have
dreamt myself discussing poems with Miguel Hernández, walking Borges
across a sublime library, or drinking a cold beer with Bertrand Russell.
On each occasion, our conversations were rich and I could recollect them
after waking up.

In everything I seek love, and in almost everything I find it. The
pursuit of knowledge is, to me, romantic—as much as the pursuit of
artistic expression and human affection—. Though, on intellectual
matters, I strive for clarity and precision, I do not confuse these
qualities with the sterile and passionless attitude which characterizes
academic writing. Bewilderment is the precursor of science—in any
matter the essential question is *what are the facts*—but thought is
not and cannot be merely *fact enumeration*. In the pursuit of knowledge
there is a sense of mystery which can only be equated to the fathomless
perplexities of human passion. If one writes as one thinks, all
these—fact and mystery, precision and passion—intertwine.

If I confuse myself or write equivocally on some matter, I pay little
attention to it. I treat my trains of thought as axiomatically dubious,
and see myself as neither wise nor expert, so what shame could I feel in
not attaining truth, when I deem myself so ill-prepared? If I happen to
find a truth, or to demonstrate a property, I feel unspeakable joy. But
if I fail to do so, which is most often the case, and like Tantalus
cannot attain the fruit that I unceasingly envision, I feel no
frustration nor consider this a curse: the beauty lies in the struggle, and
failure causes me no anguish. And so, as one can see, I am so disposed that I
stand with nothing to loss and much to win.

And so my writings come to be: eclectic and unorganized, dubious and vain, more
a testament to how close or far I get to see than to what there is to see. If
anything, aside from serving me to put certain things in order, and to reach a
cathartic equilibrium, the only question they can answer is not *what did he
know* but *what did he think about*?
