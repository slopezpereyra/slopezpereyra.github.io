How longingly I have wished to find you here in the solitary corridors of
dreams. Do you recall the secret which was my offering to you? Do you recall how
young the dreams I dreamt, how juvenile the shyness of my eyes? Remember now how
well it stood the truth there dripping from my lips. Now I have learnt that love
is ineternal---for everyone, and for us too---. The flow of life is
irresistible. Nothing is true but for a day.

I wrote to you one day that I was like the wind. Draw your curtains open, I
said, and I shall flow to you, so that you may become a stranger to solitude. We
were but children. The moon was shining clear. Your face was that of early
youth. And now I cannot draw my mind away from thinking about the windlessness
of the earth.

To love is to uphold the entirety of a being, as if it was a final offering, the
one and only sacrifice which could bargain the forgiveness of our god. Here in
my house, alone, I sit alone and write at night, alone, that I uphold you.
Still, after all these years... I speak your name so that you become a spell. I
vividly imagine you, so that you become a ghost. 

I must remember you, so as to live this searching life which gives the memory of
you.
