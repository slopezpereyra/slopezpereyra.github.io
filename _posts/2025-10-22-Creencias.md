title: On seeing people as they are

Nothing is simultaneously as mysterious and apparent as the belief systems
which, on every turn, guide our actions and our words. Even when (and if) these
beliefs are discerned, we seldom acquire the profundity of knowledge necessary
to fathom how deep within ourselves they are rooted nor what universe of experiences
configured them in the first place. A man expresses a fear we deem irrational, a
resentment we judge vile, a sentiment we suppose obscure, but very rarely
do we penetrate its essence nor take it as a lens through which to observe the
deeper personality. If we could suspend judgment, the words and actions of
others would be to us like strange kaleidoscopes. Individuals appear before us
like a stream, some more tempestuous than others, but all flowing like water
more transparent than we imagine. And if we could be not like the rock which
resists and is circumvented by the water, but like a tadpole that follows its
direction, not passive nor resisting, not being carried away, not swimming
countercurrent either, who knows how rich and true the face of human condition
would appear before us?
