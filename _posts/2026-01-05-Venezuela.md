title: What to make of US intervention in Venezuela 
categories: [Política]

A few days ago, the United States performed a swift operation in Venezuela,
cutting its electrical power, bombing strategic facilities, and abducting
Nicolás Maduro, all in the course of approximately three hours. As early as
February 2025, the Trump administration accused Maduro of organizing criminal
activity with the Tren de Aragua organization, a claim that contradicted US
intelligence [[1]]. On March, Trump imposed 25% tariffs to all countries
importing crude oil or petroleum products extracted, refined, or exported from
Venezuela [[2], [3]]. In October, Trump explicitly authorized the CIA to carry
out secret operations in Venezuela [[4]], and it seems Maduro was under constant
surveillance by stealth drones prior to his abduction [[5]]. In November, the
United States announced the «Southern Spear» mission, with numerous, unlawful
attacks on Caribbean vessels which the US claims—with no evidence—were
trafficking drugs [[6], [7], [8]]. During the same month, the US deployed the
largest aircraft carrier to the Caribbean and near the coast of Venezuela [[9]]
and effectively closed Venezuelan airspace [[10]]. So Maduro's abduction is
nothing but the foreseeable culmination of relatively open and transparent
events.

Discussions of these events, in my opinion, revolve too much around the personal
figure of Maduro. Though not extensively, I have written about the blatant human
rights violations under Maduro's regime elsewhere [[11]] and have been following
Amnesty International's coverage of political violence and repression in the
country. I do not wish to repeat myself nor dwell on all-too-known facts,
accepting not only that Maduro's regime was brutal and corrupt, but also that
the 2024 elections were likely fraudulent and sustained only by unacceptable
violence and use of force [[12]]. 

But internal corruption or government violence do not justify exterior
intervention, neither morally nor legally. The US actions are a direct violation
of the UN Charter, which prohibits «threat or use of force against the
territorial integrity or political independence of any state» [[13]]. The act
unequivocally constitutes the Crime of Aggression as specified in the Rome
Statute of the International Criminal Court [[14]]—though both the US and
Venezuela withdrew from the statute [[15], [16]], obviously because neither
could seriously claim to respect its clauses—.

If one accepts that domestic corruption or authoritarianism justifies regime
change, invasion, or any other form of foreign aggression, one must then
elaborate an impossible argument detailing how and who determines which
governments are corrupt or not. Furthermore, one must readily accept and in fact
endorse that similar actions be taken, effective immediately, against equally
corrupt states, such as those of Saudi Arabia, Israel, or Serbia. In fact, as
should be evident, accepting this principle would lead to such general chaos
that human civilization would become an impossible project.

There is, I grant, one sense in which Maduro's own political gravitas may be
relevant to understanding the events hereby described. Namely, that had he not
been a brutal oppressor, the reputational cost of overthrowing him would have
been greater, perhaps sufficiently greater so as to discourage such direct
operation. But this is speculative, and in general terms one should examine the
overthrow of Maduro independently of the fact that he was a dictator.

Venezuela, as everyone knows, is rich in oil, and Donald Trump has declared US
will run the country and tap into its oil reserves [[17]]. In fact, the shares
of US oil companies are already on a rise [[18]]. Trump declared that Venezuela
had «stolen» US oil through force. In fact, Venezuelan oil was nationalized in
1976—decades before Chávez came to power—with $1 billion dollars being
agreed as compensation for oil companies [[19], [20]]. Venezuela is also rich in
coltan [[21]], coal, gold, and gas [[22], [23]], all of which are important
resources.

Venezuela is not only an economic interest, but a geopolitical one. Securing
Venezuelan oil means not only revenue for the United States but cutting Russian
and Chinese access to it. Russia and Venezuela had long-standing and
multi-millionaire oil deals [[24]]. Venezuela is the fourth-biggest recipient of
loans from China—the US is the first—and prior to Maduro's abduction, most
of Venezuelan oil was being sold to China and the US [[25]]. The Cuban
government, which still has a powerful symbolic charge attached to it, strongly
depended on Venezuelan oil [[26]], and Trump has stated that «Cuba is ready to
fall» [[27]].

The openness with which the United States committed this illegal attack, as well
as the transparency of its motives, should be unsurprising when viewed as
nothing but a continuation of the long-standing Monroe doctrine. Henchmen and
minions are rewarded, while anyone opposing US interests is more or less
brutally destroyed. But however unsurprising, the record being set is
preoccupying. The Trump administration is hardening its grip on the Western
hemisphere, making dangerous military threats to Colombia [[28]] and Denmark
[[29]].

The reestablishment of the Monroe doctrine is explicitly declared in the last
*National Security Strategy* [[30]], released in December 2025, where US foreign
policy is framed. As usual, this official document is frank about the US's
imperial ambitions. It begins declaring that «the sole purpose» of US
foreign policy is «the protection of core national interests». These interests,
the document claims, have been cast aside in favor of globalism and free trade,
lashing US policy to an international order which is anti-American. 
A key objective is to «maintain the United States’ unrivaled “soft power” through
which we exercise positive influence throughout the world that furthers our
interests», accurately adding that this soft power is only effective if the
population is persuaded of the «inherent greatness and decency» of their
country. For this an other purposes, the document declares that «we will assert
and enforce a “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine». An when declaring
«predisposition to non-interventionism» as a principle of international affairs,
the document rapidly adds that «for a country whose interests are as numerous
and diverse as ours, rigid adherence to non-interventionism is not possible».
These are only a few of its passages relevant to understanding the US
intervention in Venezuela. The reader is encouraged to consult the full text
[[30]].


It should be clear, then, that the removal of Nicolás Maduro is nothing more
than a calculated assertion of hemispheric dominance. Trump's administration
keeps signaling that the principles of non-intervention and self-determination
are subordinate to US strategic interests. We cannot accept this revival of the
Monroe Doctrine as a «necessary evil» in the overthrow of a dictator, as doing
so implicitly consents to the erosion of the very legal frameworks designed to
prevent global conflict. It is now commonplace to claim that international law
is meaningless, with hegemons acting as they please in both hemispheres. But we
must insist on international law, if only because it is all we have.
