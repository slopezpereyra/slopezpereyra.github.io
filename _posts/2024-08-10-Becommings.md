Nothing can truly *be*. I drew a curve today which dreams to be a sphere.
It reaches, it aspires - but it cannot achieve.

It is beautiful, isn't it? As $k$ tends to infinity, there is no point in an
origin-centered sphere with radius $r$ which cannot be traversed by the curve.
But the curve will never be the sphere.

To live is not to be, but to become. Whatever *is*, is dead.
