title: Adaptive integrate-and-fire neuron model
categories: [ Science ]
---

In a [Leaky integrate-and-fire neuron
model](https://slopezpereyra.github.io/2024-01-01-Leaky/), we discussed a simple
model of action potential generation based on Lapicque's work. Some neurons, for
example cortical pyramidal cells, show a slight decrease in their firing rate
until a certain stable rate is reached. This phenomenon is termed spike-rate
adaption.

Firstly, recall the basic leaky integrate-and-fire model, where a single leakage
current is considered.


$$ \tau_{m} \frac{dV}{dt} = E_{L}-V + R_{m}I_{e} $$

In order to include spike-rate adaption, we can include an extra current in the
model with a certain conductance $g_{sra}$. This current is modeled as a $K^{+}$
flow; thus, it is a hyperpolarizing current flowing out of the cell (positive
sign) with an equilibrium potential $E_{K}$. 


$$\begin{equation} \tau_{m} \frac{dV}{dt} = E_{L}-V + R_{m}I_{e} - r_mg_{sra}(V-E_{K}) \end{equation}$$

We follow Dayan and Abbot in assuming that this conductance relaxes to zero
exponentially obeying 

$$\tau_{sra} \frac{dg_{sra}}{dt} = -g_{sra}$$

Here, $r_m$ is a constant of proportionality that determines
the strength of the influence of the hyperpolarizing current. For example, $r_m$
may be understood to reflect the density of the $K^{+}$ channels involved in the
spike-rate adaptation. Greater values of $r_m$ naturally imply a stronger degree
of adaptation. 

To model spike-rate adaptation, after each spike we increase $g_{sra}$ by a
certain amount $\Delta g_{sra}$. We do this specifically by altering the initial
condition of $g_{sra}$ (the value of $A$ in its derivation) after each spike.
Thus, the hyperpolarizing current increases after each spike, further
difficulting the generation of an action potential and thus effectively increasing
interspike intervals.

Let us derive the voltage function of this model. Observe that integrating
equation $(1)$ yields

$$ 
\begin{align*}
    \tau_m \int \frac{1}{E_L+R_mI_E-V-r_mg_{sra}V+r_mg_{sra}E_K} dV&= \int dt \newline 
    \tau_m \int \frac{1}{V(-r_mg_{sra}-1)+u}dV &= t+C \newline 
    \tau_m \int \frac{1}{Vw+u} dV &= t+C
\end{align*}
$$

Let $z = Vw+u$ so that $dz = w dV$. Then 

$$
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\tau_m}{w}\int \frac{1}{z} dz &= t+C \newline 
    \ln |z| &= \frac{tw}{\tau_m} + C' \newline 
    z&= A\exp(tw/\tau_m)
\end{align*}
$$

It follows that 

$$
V(t)= \frac{A\exp(tw/\tau_n) - u}{w}
$$

If $t = 0$ then $V(0) = (A - u)/w$ from which follows $A= V(0)w+u$.

This is sufficient for us to implement our model. We will use the same
parameters as in  [Leaky integrate-and-fire neuron
model](https://slopezpereyra.github.io/2024-01-01-Leaky/) for the leaky current.
The $K^{+}$ adaptation-inducing current is modeled with a conductance of $100$,
$\tau_{sra} = 1, Δg_{sra} = 40, r_{m} = 0.1$ and $E_K = -70$. Except for the
equilibrium potential of $K^{+}$, the other parameters were not selected to
match real experimental data but rather to clearly show the adaptation.

```julia
using Plots

const τ = 10
const dt = 0.1

const Eₖ = -70
const τₛ = 1
const rₘ = 0.1
const Δg = 40

function gsra(t, gₛ)
    if t == 0 
        return gₛ

    if t == 0
        return(V₀)
    end 
    u = equilibrium_potential + membrane_resistance * external_current + rₘ * gsra(t, gₛ)*Eₖ
    w = -rₘ*gsra(t, gₛ) - 1
    
    (V(0, gₛ)*exp(t*w/τ)-u)/w
end

function sim(T, dt, gₛ)
    v = V₀
    values = []
    t = 0
    for i in 0:dt:T
        if v == 1 
            v = Vᵣ  
            push!(values, v)
            t = 0
            gₛ += Δg
            continue
        end
        if v > threshold 
            v = 1 
            push!(values, v)
            continue
        end
        v = V(t, gₛ) 
        t += dt
        push!(values, v)
    end
    plot(0:dt:T, values, xlabel="Time", ylabel="Membrane Potential", label="Membrane Potential")
end

sim(100, 0.1, 100)
