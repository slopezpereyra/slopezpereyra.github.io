# Foreword

I wish to put in writing some observations on an intellectual matter I
deem of special interest. One could perhaps dare to reduce it to the
study of brains. In this sense, the matter is circumscribed to the
inquiry of what may be termed a ''representative instinct'' in mankind.
Such '' instinct''—I use the term loosely for now—is plausibly the
byproduct of the emergence of symbolic faculties in instinctive beings.
This may not be too precise, but it is also not blatantly wrong, and
thus I accept it as a decent preliminary formulation. I am speaking of
what a peculiar branch of psychoanalysis termed *archetypes*.

The object of this inquiry, I must say, was not originally conceived to
be of biological nature, and I do wish to attend to the earlier
formulations of the concept of *archetype*. Firstly, because in the
genealogy of any scientific idea there are large branches of—in
general quite illuminating—pre-scientific antecedents. Secondly,
because the hypothesis that concerns us goes far beyond the scope of
scientific inquiry, raising questions about human nature itself.

As a last preliminary comment, I should wish to say the following:
although the concept, as we postulate it, has a tighter link with
scientific understanding than its original formulations, and although a
considerable amount of empirical work has been set forth by affective
neuroscience on its favor, the existence of archetypes is still merely a
hypothesis. Only the scientific study of brain functioning can
ultimately provide satisfactory evidence in favour or against it. It is
probably the case that mind-problems are of the kind where propositions
are to be measured only in that way—by the weight of existing
evidence, and not by conclusive proof. A love for sharp edges and rigor
compels me to limit the scope of my speculation to what I deem to be in
line with this evidence and our current scientific understanding of the
brain. It is utterly short-sighted to claim that reason can only delve
into matters where certain knowledge exists (or could exist). The
advancement of science itself must always begin with educated
conjectures, and a philosophical attitude towards uncertain matters can
*at least*, when executed correctly, reveal the right and the wrong
questions to be raised.

# Archetypes

The term archetype dates back at least to Pseudo-Dionysius the
Areopagite, who suggested an echo (*apekhémata*) of the divine
essence exists on every sensible object, by virtue of which they may
elevate to the immaterial *arkhitypía*. Here, the word expresses the
perfect platonic ideal of which each sensible object is an imperfect
realization. This is not the sense of the term that interests
us—although the notion of *echo* (or *imprint, trace*, etc.) will be
relevant. In fact, our issue is partly the different meanings the term
ascribes to across traditions and contexts. Even the work of Jung, that
elevated the term to an unprecedented intellectual dimension, lacks an
unequivocal definition, sometimes confronting us with the suspicion that
the very author bestows it with different meanings depending on the
period of his intellectual life or the object of his exposition.

It is my opinion that this linguistic issue is not as daunting as it may
appear at first. A simple reason is that many of the meanings commonly
attributed to the term can be readily disregarded as nonsensical.
Secondly, some advances in the field of neuroscience—particularly in
the line of research set forth by Panksepp—have contributed a great
amount of empirical material to the question. This rich set of facts
lays out more plausible—and potentially falsifiable—notions of what
may be meant by "archetype". In other words, though the riddle is far
from answered, we have at our disposal a whole domain of reality that
the ancient philosophers—or early psychoanalysts—lacked. Thus, the
contending formulations, to our surprise, are in the end not very
numerous.

It then becomes the question how to penetrate into the essence of the
formulations at hand. For this purpose, aside from the consideration of
empirical evidence, I intend to follow two elementary principles.
Firstly, to assess the amount of presuppositions implied in each of
them. Secondly, to think of their meaning as determined by the sensible
effects the concept is represented to produce. In the latter lies
whatever is to be meant by the concept; in the first, its intellectual
economy.

# Jung

Jung had an explicitly dualistic outlook on the psyche. He endorsed the
philosophical stance according to which there is no evidence in favor of
the hypothesis that links psychological phenomena to physical and
chemical processes, that there is no reason to regard the mind as an
epiphenomenon of matter, and that it should be treated as a *sui
generis* factor—at least until the artificial creation of a mind can
be established as an achievable endeavor. This is explicitly held in the
work *Archetypes of the collective unconscious*, written around 1932.
The state of evidence at the time may perhaps make this claim
understandable. However, at least to my knowledge, he never explicitly
relinquished it.

Jung frequently associated the notion of archetype to that of primordial
image. This association is particularly present whenever he was
interested in drawing the parallelism between mythological motifs and
the archetypal phenomena he allegedly witnessed in his clinical work. He
also ties the concept of archetype to the notion of pattern of
functioning:

> Like every animal, he \[the man\] possesses a preformed psyche which
> breeds true to his species and which (\...) reveals distinct features
> traceable to family antecedents. (\...) We are unable to form any idea
> of what those dispositions or aptitudes are which make instinctive
> actions in animals possible. And it is just as impossible for us to
> know the nature of the preconscious psychic disposition that enables a
> child to react in a human manner. We can only suppose that his
> behavior results from patterns of functioning, which I have described
> as images. The term "image" is intended to express not only the form
> of the activity taking place, but the typical situation in which the
> activity is released" — 1959, pag. 78.

This evolutionary speculation is not trivial. It is in line with more
recent expositions, such as those elaborated in the work of Campbell.
However, it is a rather strange twist of the logical chain to propose an
evolutionary basis for an immaterial phenomenon. The process of natural
selection affects the course of biological species made up of material
elements, all the way down to a rather peculiar acid, whose material
nature—I should hope—is uncontested. Putting that aside, to claim we
do not know the mechanisms that make instinctive actions possible is
false under the present state of science. The neuroscientific findings
seem to support, to a certain extent, the Jungian hypothesis of
"archetypal" behavioral patterns. We will come to discuss these findings
later on.

To Jung, primordial images are contentless, structural patterns—just
like an instinct, taken by itself, is also strictly formal. This is an
important point to make wherever we find those delirious babblings
mumbled by the sadly numerous followers of the new age philosophy, who
distort Jung's theories to fantasize about a world of actual images,
where this or that archetype "appears as" this or that other figure and
contains some form of sacred message. Granted, at times the author made
it easy for such misinterpretations to be drawn out of his work. But it
is also true that Jung asserted above all $a.$ the affective tone of
these "primordial images", and $b.$ that they should be understood not
by virtue of an essential content but by their teleology—*id est*, the
specific behavioral disposition induced by them.

> But we only arrive at the meaning of a physical organ when we begin to
> ask teleological questions. Hence the query arises: What is the
> biological purpose of the archetype? —1959, pag. 161.

It continues to be unclear in what way the biological conception of the
archetype and the immaterial notion of the psyche may theoretically
harmonize. But we shall leave this question aside for the moment to
discuss a bit more deeply about these primordial images, or patterns of
behavior.

With regards to their teleology, one mustn't too hastily convince
himself that it exists. A fair number of biological traits are nothing
but the byproduct of others. A general idea is that the phenomenology of
archetypes—the specific behavioral dispositions that are understood to
be archetypal—is the induction of an affective state by stimuli to
which we were once selected to respond affectively, or stimuli
resembling other to which we were selected to respond affectively, even
when at the present state of history such response is unwarranted. To
rephrase: In the same way the fact that sucrose was once scarce makes us
feel a compulsive appetite for it even today, other stimuli are also
imbued with, so to speak, archaic affect. In this regard, we find a
clarifying and mundane example in *The Masks of God: Primitive
Mythology*, by Campbell.

> Chicks with their eggshells still adhering to their tails dart for
> cover when a hawk flies overhead, but not when the bird is a gull or
> duck, heron or pigeon. Furthermore, if the wooden model of a hawk is
> drawn over their coop on a wire, they react as though it were
> alive—unless it be drawn backward, when there is no response.
>
> Here we have an extremely precise image—never seen before, yet
> recognized with reference not merely to its form but to its from in

> chicks, we should find the sudden eruption difficult to explain.
> 'Whence', we may ask, 'this abrupt seizure by an image to which there
> is no counterpart in the chicken's world? ($\ldots$)'.

It is not difficult to observe what is being suggested in this passage.
Namely, that there were now non-present stimuli imbued with affect by
virtue of evolutionary archaic systems; that the responses elicited by
these stimuli were arguably propitious to survival; that these archaic
responses can be evoked by ''accidents of art'', provoking seemingly
unwarranted responses in people. The psychologist that risks to say this
draws his attention, of course, to all those affective motifs deemed
universal in human experience: patterns suspected to be ubiquitous even
across different religious contexts and times, appearing with equal
strength in uncommunicated cultures as in the spontaneous production of
individual people.

The scope of this alleged universality is not altogether clear. Some
have proposed general practices but not particular images to fall within
it. Shamanism may be a good example. Others have drawn their attention
to particular imaginations: for example, that of the universal flood. I
do not wish to discuss this point, for I cannot see a way to
circumscribe the speculation within a limiting frame. And where there is
place for unbounded speculation there is no place for truth. So, having
presented a general overview of the more or less pre-scientific
conception of *archetypes*, I should wish to proceed with the equally
interesting—but more epistemologically promising—attempts of
neuroscience at tackling this question.

# Archaic affect

Allow me to advance that I shall not give too much detail on the
neurobiology of the findings here commented. Doing so would make this
writing much longer and technical than I intend. I should rather wish to
summarize what I understand to be the principal conclusions and
postulates of affective neuroscience and their relationship to the
concept of *archetype*. Before discussing these contributions, however,
it is pertinent to say a few words concerning both their ontology and
their epistemology. This is important because discussions concerning the
mind are famously problematic, and it would be imprudent to simply delve
into the neuroscience before addressing a few concerns.

With regards to ontology, it is a common mistake to believe that
Descartes committed an intellectual sin when postulating his *res
cogitans*. In fact, when doing so, he acted in accord with standard
scientific practice. It is obvious that certain human faculties cannot
be explained by mechanical laws. If matter was to be entirely described
by the laws of mechanics, as was the stance at Descarte's time, then
some other substance had to be postulated in order to explain these
non-mechanistic faculties. When Newton and Galileo postulated *forces*,
they were doing so in similar conditions. Rather than a positive
scientific achievement, such postulate was a problematic, but
inescapable necessity.

The standard philosophical stance today is a commitment to a materialist
monism. I share this stance—but the conundrum which forced Descartes
to reject monism remains. It seems that, rather than postulating a new
substance, the appropriate position is a form of Spinozian *dual-aspect
monism*, as Panksepp described it. It is a fact that thought emerges
from matter—it is happening now as I write—but it is plausible that
properties emergent from matter are better understood in non-material
terms. This is in no sense an ontological claim; I simply state that a
complex system may be not be properly described by the same laws which
describe its constitutive elements. So, it seems the missing piece which
Descartes' *res cogitans* aimed to account for were, in fact, complex
neural dynamics. *How* complex neural dynamics may produce thought,
emotion, etc., pertains to scientific inquiry rather than to
philosophical speculation. Affective neuroscience, in particular the
work of Panksepp and Damasio, has provided an immense corpus of evidence
in favor of the notion that conciousness is not only an emergence of
complex neural organization, but particularly of those deep regions of
the brain whose function seems to be the realization of emotion and
affect.

With regards to epistemology, the principal question is: How can we
study emotions scientifically? The answer to this question is given by
three observations which are, to me, scientifically impeccable. *(1)*
Animals exhibit outward indicators of emotional states. The clearest
example are the separation distress calls. *(2)* We can inquire on the
neurobiology regulating such expressions using standard scientific
methods. *(3)* If artificial exposition to the neurobiological
regulators of such emotions produces corresponding *feelings* in humans,
the weight of the evidence favors the conclusion that animals also
experience these feelings—at least when the brain systems involved are
homologous. For example, in a paper entitled *Opioid blockade and social
comfort in chicks* (1980), Panksepp showed that opioid blockade with
naloxone reduced the imprinting effect in chicks. More generally, his
findings at the time suggested that opioids mediate social interaction
and bonding. More recent papers of his added a great deal of evidence to
this claim. We know certain opioids, such as oxytocin, mediate human
bonding and partially regulate the feelings of warmness and care
present, for instance, between a newborn and a mother. Since the
neurobiological circuitry involved is homologous in both species, it is
not unreasonable to claim that similar feelings permeate the bond
between a little chick and its mother.

As a last note, and to put this preamble aside, I should say that I
follow Panksepp's terminology. By *emotion*, I mean any affective,
cognitive, behavioral or physiological change in the organism. In this
sense, the word is more tightly linked to its etymology than to its
conversational meaning. By *affect*, I mean quite broadly any subjective
and experiential feelings, whereas an *emotional affect* denotes the
experiential component of an internal brain state.

Emotional affects are generally associated to external events. When
compared to external inductors of affect, internal ones (e.g. the memory
of a deceased loved one) are rather few, and perhaps limited to our own
species. Even so, every affect is an internal function of the brain.
Scientists have used the terms *valence, arousal* and *surgency* to
describe different aspects of the affective experience, without ever
daring to speak of emotions. The present state of science, so I believe,
conclusively leads to the fact that such terms would make no sense if
not denoting affect.

The essential thesis of affective neuroscience as a field, as far as I
understand it, is the following: that affective experience ''reflects a
primitive form of consciousness which was the evolutionary platform for
the emergence of more complex forms of consciousness'' (Panksepp,
*Affective consciousness: Core emotional feelings in animals and
humans*, 2005). Here, *consciousness* refers to ''brain states that have
an experiential feel to them, and it is envisioned as a multi-tiered
process that needs to be viewed in evolutionary terms, with multiple
layers of emergence.'' (*idem*).

The evidence in favour of this thesis is close to overwhelming and, to
my eyes, at least in essence, little doubt remains about their truth.
There are, of course, disputes concerning technicalities—the manner in
which different ways of consciousness evolved, the neurobiology
modulating certain aspects of consciousness—but the essential claim
remains untouched. Not only is the experiential component of emotion
common to, at least, all mammals, but it represents a primitive form of
consciousness that is still present in the human brain. This presence is
attested by the fact that the systems from which such form of
consciousness emerges remain very well preserved and highly homologous
across mammal species. It is this evolutionary insight what draws a link
between the conclusions of affective neuroscience and pre-scientific
speculations on psychological archetypes.

Panksepp used the term *equalia* (*e* from evolutionary, *qualia* from
its traditional philosophical sense) to denote the varieties of positive
or negative feelings not simply mediated by our perceptual interfaces,
but by the orchestration of inherited emotional systems in the brain.
The raw affects engendered by such subcortical systems are '' ancestral
memories (instincts) that promote survival'' (the reader is surely
reminded of Campbell's example of the chick and the eagle).

It is not hard to see that these ''ancestral memories'' are what Jung
termed *primordial images*. Needless to say, a highly complex, and in
many senses still impenetrable interplay exists between the archaic
emotional systems of the mammalian brain and the cortical regions to
which our own species owns its so-called superior faculties.
Notwithstanding, these cortical regions are entirely inessential to
primary forms of consciousness; such forms subsist even in extreme cases
of virtually non-existing cortical development. This was proven not only
in Panksepp's work, but quite famously by Damasio as well.

Indeed, it seems that consciousness is like a curl or (in Spanish)
*rizo*; the superior aspects of it can be removed while preserving
pre-conscious affect, but whenever its primitive components are lost,
nothing of it subsists. The different ''levels'' of consciousness have
been described in the neuroscientific literature as *primary, secondary*
and *tertiary* consciousness; or as *core consciousness* and *extended
consciousness*. Regardless of the terminology, lower levels of
consciousness have been demonstrated to depend on the primitive,
value-encoding neurocircuitry described before. In short, consciousness
can exist without cognition—but it cannot be without affect.

The relationship between the neurocircuitry of affective experience and
cognitively complex phenomena, such as spirituality or dreams, has not
been explored so far. However, in so far as affect is, virtually by
definition, value-encoding, it seems necessary that spiritual experience
is some kind of cognitive sublimation of these archaic components of
human experience. This would at least account for $a.$ the striking
structural similarities across the wide range of so-called archetypal
stories and beliefs—the hero story, animism, shamanism, etc.—*b.*
the profound affect with which such stories and beliefs are imbued; and
$c$. the absolute resilience of such narratives in a scientific society.
The same can be said of dreams.

There is one peculiarly interesting paper, [The affective Core of the
Self](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01424/full), which
surveys the insight provided by affective neuroscience into one of the specific
archetypes proposed by Jung. I will let the reader judge the conclusions of this
paper on his own; they do not differ from what I have described thus far but in
scope and technical precision.

# Summary

Let us return to Campbell's quote:

For all practical purposes, it is correct to say an *ancestral memory* exists in
the chick; one embedded in deep and ancient subcortical systems that mediate
affective experience. Campbell's example shows, in practical terms, what I think
is to be understood by *archetype*. I gather it is correct to say the existence
of archetypes, so understood, has passed from an educated conjecture to a
soundly evidenced claim. Somewhere in his complete works—I remember not
where—Jung states that we are, so to speak, *thousands of years old*. It turns
out this is sensibly true.

Notwithstanding, two things ought to be pointed out with respect to how *little*
we have advanced thus far. Firstly, affective neuroscience described the
circuitry involved in producing emotions and concomitant feelings. This is a
great step, but it says little or nothing on *how* such circuitry produces it.
The regions of the brain which seem to produce consciousness have been mapped;
*how* they produce it remains unclear. With regards to its evolutionary
perspective, one must not forget how little it is to claim that affect
and emotion are part of the biological endowment of the mammalian brain. In this
sense, affective neuroscience has provided evidence, as well as a considerable
amount of detail, with regards to a claim that on itself is not altogether
revolutionary. The only finding of affective neuroscience that truly deviates
from standard thought is that which links consciousness to emotional affects
rather than to superior cognitive faculties. The rest consists mainly of the
empirical consolidation of ethological facts known many decades ago—as
illustrated by Campbell's example.

Secondly, recall that I initially formulated the object of this writing,
although tentatively, as a "representative instinct" in mankind. I think this is
what Jung had in mind when he spoke of archetypes. The findings we have
discussed miss in supporting such formulation in two opposite senses. Firstly,
they uncover a field of affective experience that, ranging at least across all
mammalian species, greatly surpasses mankind itself. In this sense, they go too
far. Conversely, they disregard the highly complex and still impenetrable
interplay of cortical activity with the deep regions of the brain that mediate
affective experience. In this sense, they don't go far enough. If one wishes to
speak of this inherited, value-encoding circuitry as a representative instinct,
fair enough—this means one must accept that a certain representation mediates
the chick's response to the hawk's figure. However, it seems to me this pushes
too far the use of the term *representation*. This term implies a certain degree
of awareness; but affective experience requires no awareness at all. This is, in
fact, one of the most extraordinary findings of affective neuroscience, one that
receives too little attention it seems to me: That *affect* can exist without
*awareness*. Jung wrote, in *Archetypes of the collective unconscious*, that
awareness of thought surely was posterior to thought itself. This conjecture is
today an established scientific assertion. In conclusion, I think it is too soon
to speak of archetypal *representations*. Whatever is to be meant by *archetype*
is simultaneously more complex and more mundane than originally imagined by
analytic psychology.

An extension of what was said before is the conclusion that Jung was as right as
he was wrong. A rich interplay must exist between the archaic affects that
mediate, and in fact make possible, our experience of the world, and our
cognitive and representational faculties. However, I do not think Jung's
archetypes (*shadow*, *anima/animus*, etc.) are consistent with the nature of
these primordial realizers of consciousness. The only exception to this is,
perhaps, what he termed the *self* archetype. At the same time, he was right in
asserting that human, and in fact mammalian experience cannot be considered
without regard to its evolutionary history, and in advancing the idea that
certain "primordial images", archaic and imbued with affect, had not only to
exist, but to be essential to the configuration of psychic phenomena.

Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, I repeat, suggested a celestial echo (*apekhémata*)
exists in every sensible thing; and that by virtue of such imprint they
may reach the immaterial *arkhitypía*. The *ancient memories* revealed
by neuroscience, quite curiously, have something of both of these Greek
concepts. They are *apekhémata* insofar as they are an ancestral trace,
an evolutionary imprint that, so to speak, echoes through time by means
of millennial evolution. They are *arkhitypía* in that they exist deep
beyond the cognitive regions of our brain, evoking typical patterns of
behavior across a range of biological species, while being perhaps
impossible to represent by means of pure cognition or imagination. One can only
imagine how broad and deep our affective dispositions, particularly those that
exist well beyond the reach of conscious thought.
