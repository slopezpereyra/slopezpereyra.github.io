I dreamt of a high mountain. And at the top there was music. I woke up in peace
and went in search of my
[*Oblivion*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dF-IMQzd_Jo&ab_channel=m_h_aboulezz)
sheet. An arrangement for classical guitar. And having lost the track of time I
came to see that I had conquered it.

The conquest of a piece of music is the purest form of attainment. 
Inciting no desire it makes you rich. And the melody is
thereafter always sounding ---even in the coldest silence. 

My favorite passage from the piece:

I come to think I am never alone. Wherever I go my mind is mumbling a poem or a
melody. With that alone I feel the richer of men. As Dylan Thomas said:

  <p style="text-align: justify; display: inline-block;">
I who was rich was made the richer <br>
by sipping at the vine of days.
