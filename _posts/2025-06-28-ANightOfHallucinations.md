title: A night of hallucinations

Last night I suffered the worst sequence of sleep paralysis episodes in my life.
As I noted in some other of my personal entries, I have suffered from sleep
paralysis intermittently ever since my adolescence. The first attack occurred
when I was fifteen years old, in Valladolid, Spain. The malady came to stay.

In my case, sleep paralysis most frequently comes when, awakened during a
regular night of sleep, I try to fall asleep again. The so-called *evil presence
hallucination* is the most frequent one, which manifests itself very vaguely in
most cases, though not lacking from time to time an image as concrete as
terrifying. Auditory hallucinations are the most common ones; tactile
hallucinations, the rarest.

I have so much experience with this horrific phenomenon that I am capable of
staying calm and preserve my temper until I am released from its grip. However,
the episode often manifests itself in a never-ending loop: I have sleep
paralysis, I suffer, I awaken. Then I try to sleep again, I have paralysis, I
suffer, I awaken. And so on. This often continues until my will falters and I
desist from sleeping again. Perhaps for this reason, however calmly I endure the
suffering, the phenomenon causes a great physical and psychological fatigue.

Last night, for the first time in years, my defenses were absolutely broken. A
series of extremely bizarre episodes assaulted me, during most of which I was
unable to keep my cool. The worst one, by far, went more or less like this. 

As I try to fall sleep, the episode ensues. There is a rapid, frantic clatter of
claws on the floor—like a swarm of dogs prowling close by. Every sinew of my
being is oppressed by the unbearable feeling of being observed by something. My
mind speaks: «The devil came». The clattering becomes more loud but now it is
not the sound of claws but a duller, more muffled sound, like steps taken by
the naked feet of invisible people walking franticly. Then the parade comes: Naked
men and women walk like dogs: quadruped, four-footed, insane. I cannot see their
faces. Some climb to my bed and move around it, pressing on my legs, abdomen and
chest. Though their bodies are anatomically identical to a human's, there is
something inhumane about them that goes well beyond the fact that they walk
quadrupedally. A spiritual property. They are devilish and it is clear they came
from hell. It feels like an eternity but eventually I wake up.

Now, an insensible reader might dismiss these images as fantasies. Yet, he must
recall that the individual hallucinating perceives his vision as truly, as
concretely, as undeniably as he is perceiving this screen, that sheet of paper,
the light and color of the table or sit he occupies, the subtle sensation of his
shirt pressed against his sin or the inexplicable whiteness of the moon. There
is nothing vague in a vision, at least not *during* the vision, and whatever
vagueness it has is distinguished only afterwards by the examination of the sane
mind—just like during a dream the rarest of things are totally natural, and only
the vigil's mind deems them fantastic—.

The fact that I was unable to oppose my character to the terrors is not,
however, the only remarkable thing about last night's episodes. For the first
time, and perhaps due to the many number of episodes and their severe intensity,
I was haunted by a strange sense of irreality during the first hours of the
waking day. This feeling probably gained its strength from the  fact that,
repeatedly during the night, as I tried to sleep again, I was not immediately
captured by sleep paralysis. Usually, because I would go to sleep dreading the
following attack, I would briefly dream before an episode ensued that the day
had begun, that I got out of bed and brushed my teeth or made coffee. I felt
such relief during these dreams, feeling that the night was over... Only then
paralysis came and everything began again. How could I have not felt then, after
actually awakening, that I should be assaulted once more, that the concrete
matter which surrounded me was of the fabric of dreams? 

This was truly a powerful and intense sensation which only goes to show the
fragile state of mind I was left with after so many paralyses and strange
hallucinations. It made me think of how hard it must be for people who suffer
from hallucinations due to psychiatric illness.
