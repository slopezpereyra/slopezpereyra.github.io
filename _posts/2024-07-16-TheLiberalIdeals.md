Kropotkin saw in every human creation the vast horizon of our lineage.
Everything of value, from agricultural technique to astronomy, to him
was but the blossom of a capital inherited—material and
intellectual—a relic tracing back to the common ancestry of mankind.
Rousseau, in the *Discourse*, speaking of an imaginary founder of
private property, wonders:

> How many crimes, wars, murders and how much misery and horror the
> human race might have been spared if someone had pulled up the stakes
> or filled in the ditch, and cried out to his fellows: 'Beware of
> listening to this charlatan. You are lost if you forget that the
> fruits of the earth belong to all and that the earth itself belongs to
> no one'.

Smith warns against the \"vile masters of mankind\", whose guiding maxim
is \"all for ourselves, and nothing for other people\", and states:

> As soon as the land of any country has all become private property,
> the landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never
> sowed, and demand a rent even for its natural produce.

But Smith was concerned with describing things as they were rather than
suggesting how they ought to be. *The Wealth of Nations* provides a
model for the workings of a complex system, not ethical imperatives. In
this it is, at least in principle, a scientific work. *Das Kapital*
shares this property, unlike most other works of Marx.

Yet, what in *The Wealth of Nations* does originate from a moral
attitude, sprouts from the same ideals which drove French and German
romantic traditions—which include the young Marx. It would not be
surprising that even educated readers would confuse a random passage
from *The Wealth of Nations* with, say, the *Manuscripts of 1848*. From
an ideological perspective, the similarities are unsurprising. It
*should* be a triviality to identify Enlightened ideals with the
primitive utopians—e.g. the likes of Étienne Cabet—as well as
modern socialists. The fact that this identification is not perceived,
even by public intellectuals, is (pun intended) illuminating.

But what was the liberal ideal? It is of course impossible to reduce a
complex and rich tradition to a few sentences. Yet certain key features
are common across its spectrum. These are, for instance, that freedom to
exercise critical thought and creative activity, in solitude or in
association with others, is fundamental. That people ought to be
educated enough so as to be capable of independence, and powerful enough
so as to be capable of influence. That selling or renting oneself is
degrading, as it's degrading that work is so alien to a man's
inclinations that he must be bribed or coerced to do it by fear of
inanition. And a long etc.

Economical considerations were subordinated to these, which are
philosophical in nature. So, the query arises: Are these ideals realized
in state capitalism? No comments. The second question is: Do liberals
today truly draw from these ideals? No comments. The third question,
after a negative of the second, is: Who aspires still to these ideals?

The world today is far, at least as far as it ever was, from realizing
them. Rather than a reason to disregard them, this is a reason to
resucitate them. So-called liberals suddenly appear as lovers of the
exercise of violence and force, apologists of tyrannies, and
subordinates to concentrated private power. This should not be
tolerated. The left, at least the libertarian left—I use the word
*libertarian* in its original sense—should persist in drawing from the
Enlightened ideals. Since they have been forgotten, since what little is
remembered is distorted, the left should resurrect them. Socialism, in
all its variations, is but an application of the fundamental liberal
principle—opposition to concentrated power—to societies where such
concentration falls on private capital and not on the court or the
state.
