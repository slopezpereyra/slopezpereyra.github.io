Kropotkin saw in every human creation the vast horizon of our lineage.
Everything of value, from agricultural technique to astronomy, to him
was but the blossom of a capital inherited—material and
intellectual—a relic tracing back to the common ancestry of mankind.
Rousseau, in the *Discourse*, speaking of an imaginary founder of
private property, wonders:

> How many crimes, wars, murders and how much misery and horror the
> human race might have been spared if someone had pulled up the stakes
> or filled in the ditch, and cried out to his fellows: 'Beware of
> listening to this charlatan. You are lost if you forget that the
> fruits of the earth belong to all and that the earth itself belongs to
> no one'.

Smith warns against the \"vile masters of mankind\", whose guiding maxim
is \"all for ourselves, and nothing for other people\", and states:

> As soon as the land of any country has all become private property,
> the landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never
> sowed, and demand a rent even for its natural produce.

But Smith was concerned with describing things as they were rather than
suggesting how they ought to be. *The Wealth of Nations* provides a
model for the workings of a complex system, not ethical imperatives. In
this it is, at least in principle, a scientific work. *Das Kapital*
shares this property, unlike most other works of Marx.

Yet, what in *The Wealth of Nations* does originate from a moral
attitude, sprouts from the same ideals which drove French and German
romantic traditions—which include the young Marx. It would not be
surprising that even educated readers would confuse a random passage
from *The Wealth of Nations* with, say, the *Manuscripts of 1848*. From
an ideological perspective, the similarities are unsurprising. It
*should* be a triviality to identify Enlightened ideals with the
primitive utopians—e.g. the likes of Étienne Cabet—as well as
modern socialists. The fact that this identification is not perceived,
even by public intellectuals, is (pun intended) illuminating.

But what was the liberal ideal? While it is impossible to reduce such
complex and rich tradition to a few sentences, certain features common
across its spectrum can be pointed out. The fundamental one is a radical
opposition to concentrated power, which conservatives conveniently confuse with
a specific opposition to the power of monarchs and the court, saving themselves
the trouble of extrapolating it to industrial forms of concentration. Another
is that freedom to excercise critical thought and creative activity, in
solitude or in association with others, is fundamental. That people ought to be
educated enough so as to be capable of independence, and powerful enough so as
to be capable of influence. That selling or renting oneself is degrading, as it
is degrading that work is so alien to a man's inclinations that he must be
bribed or coerced to do it by fear of inanition. That any form of authority
which cannot justify itself ought to be dismantled--- a principle which
liberals such as Diderot sophisticated and which saw its natural continuation
in the likes of William Godwin. And a long etc.

A fraction of the liberal discourse presents itself as an economic doctrine,
and ties it inextricably to free market economy. However, in classical liberal
works, economical considerations were subordinated to the moral and humanist
principles aforementioned. So, the query arises: Are these ideals realized in
state capitalism? No need to comment on this. The second question is: Do
liberals today truly draw from these ideals? No need to comment either. The
third question, after a negative of the second, is: Who aspires still to these
ideals?

The world today is far, at least as far as it ever was, from realizing these
ideals. And, contrary to common opinion, which likes to pad itself in the back
and cry that we live in the best of times, the human species has never been in
greater existential threat. Technological advancement and material progress,
though as always guided by the interest of concentrated power, is real, but
this does not invalidate the fact that the constant threat of nuclear war and
the looming climate disaster places human kind at its most vulnerable point in
history.

At the same time, so-called liberals suddenly appear as lovers of the exercise
of violence and force, apologists of tyrannies, and subordinates to
concentrated private power. This should not be tolerated. The left, at least
the libertarian left—I use the word *libertarian* in its original sense—should
persist in drawing from the Enlightened ideals. Since they have been forgotten,
since what little is remembered is distorted, the left should resurrect them.
Socialism, in all its variations, is but an application of the fundamental
liberal principle—opposition to concentrated power—to societies where such
concentration falls on private capital and not on the court or the state. I
fear that if a profound change is not undertaken, sooner rather than later,
human kind will not have survived to see even a primitive form of true
liberalism.
