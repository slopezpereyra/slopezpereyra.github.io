A profoundly thought-provoking work of Nietzsche, often overlooked, is the small
essay entitled *On truth and lies in a nonmoral sense*. This was the first truly
intelligent critique of science which I read, and, in all of its brevity, one
that has very rarely been matched.

I read this work at seventeen, when I was a young student in the
department of philosophy. Ten years later, today, with a few years of
experience in science and research, and close to graduating from the
mathematics department, I read it again. What I write here may be
considered a commentary on this particular work, though I should strive
to provide more general observations on the nature of scientific
knowledge as I understand it.

The central thesis of this work, at least as far as I can see, is that
scientific theories are not representations of an objective reality, but
rather the subjective (and hence ultimately arbitrary) cognitive
elaboration of certain stimuli. (Here «subjective» does not refer to the
*individual* subject, but to the *human* subject.) To Nietzsche,
inferring objective properties from the result of any such stimulation
is unwarranted:

> \[\...\] the further inference from the nerve stimulus to a cause
> outside of us is already a result of a false and unjustifiable
> application of the principle of sufficient reason.

The phrase «the stone is hard» then expresses the result of a subjective
feeling and not an objective «hardness» in the rock. A word is but the
formulation of a *qualitas occulta* underlying the infinite complexity
and multiplicity of that to which the word refers:

> Truths are illusions which we have forgotten are illusions; they are
> metaphors that have become worn out and have been drained of sensuous
> force, coins which have lost their embossing and are now considered as
> metal and no longer as coins.

Reason is understood at least partly as a self-referential and
tautological instrument:

> If I make up the definition of a mammal, and then, after inspecting a
> camel, declare "look, a mammal," I have indeed brought a truth to
> light in this way, but it is a truth of limited value.

Furthermore, inquiry through science and reason is viewed as fundamentally
anthropocentric. Oblivious to the fact that in trying to describe reality «he
again proceeds from the error of believing that he has these things immediately
before him as mere objects», the scientist acts as the astrologers who treated
stars as agents in man's service:

> It is even a difficult thing for him \[the inquirer\] to admit to
> himself that the insect or the bird perceives an entirely different
> world from the one that man does, and that the question of which of
> these perceptions of the world is the more correct one is quite
> meaningless \[\...\]

If we could perceive matters «as a bird, now as a worm, now as a plant, or if one
of us saw a stimulus as red, another as blue, while a third even heard the same
stimulus as a sound - then no one would speak of such a regularity of nature».
Quite pertinently, Nietzsche cites Pascal's famous passage on a laborer who
dreams each night that he's a king.

In my opinion, Nietzsche's insights are fundamentally correct. This early work
of his draws strongly from Schopenhauer's conception of the world as will and
representation, which I also deem fundamentally right. Such a thing as a purely
objective reality, a *ding an sich*, is not only unknowable but unimaginable.
Every species is endowed with more or less broad, but necessarily bounded
faculties of representation which are specific to it. Yet, contrary to
the belief that this undermines science, I would venture this itself constitutes
a scientific fact. Hopefully the reader will allow me to digress a bit in order
to bring forth my point.

For some reason, it is common to teach that the Newtonian revolution «overcame»
mind-body dualism by exorcising the ghost from the machine and providing a more
or less complete description of the physical world. This could not be further
from the truth. Newtonian physics is based on the concept of *force*, which
serves to correctly explain nature, but which has no material ground. The
postulates of, say, gravitational force or electrostatic force proceed simply
from *observing* that distant (i.e. non-contacting) objects attract, repel and
generally influence each other. What distinguishes the gravitational and the
electrostatic force is simply the observed properties of this otherwise arcane
interaction. There is no understanding of what the word *force* means beyond
this.[^1]

In this sense, the epithet *physical* is meaningless and serves a merely
honorific function, just like the epithet *real*. To say *the real
truth* is simply to say *the truth*, but with a certain emphasis; to say
*the physical world* is simply to say *the world*, with a certain
decoration. We have no notion of what *physical* means and, instead
of ridding ourselves of the ghost in the machine, Newton destroyed the
machine and left us with the ghost alone. [^2]

Furthermore, it is correct to claim that what we call *reality* is a
specific representation, and, to repeat Nietzsche's words, that

> \[\...\] the further inference from the nerve stimulus to a cause
> outside of us is already a result of a false and unjustifiable
> application of the principle of sufficient reason.

We can safely say certain stimuli are processed so and so, and acquire a
rather sophisticated understanding of the underpinnings of such
processing (as is the case, for instance, in the visual system). But we
are limited, both in our perception of a moving object as well as in our
description of the visual system itself, by the specific encoding which
our nervous system imposes upon the external world. A trivial corollary
of this is that human understanding has limits. It is conceivable that
our brains are simply ill-prepared to grasp certain properties of the
world—and I suspect philosophers are correct when suggesting that
mental phenomena may depend on some of these properties.

Take, for instance, the cognitive faculties of rats, a matter of
thought-provoking research. Though able to learn highly intricate mazes,
rats cannot learn to traverse a prime-maze, i.e. a maze with
$i=1,\ldots, N$ turns which is solved by the program:
$\textbf{if } i \textbf{ is prime turn right
else turn left}$. This suggests three interesting things with regard to
the way in which «reality» relates to our innate, limited
representational faculties.

 

Firstly, rats [seem to possess some sense of
numerosity](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/6/8/46) directed by what is
technically termed the approximate number system (ANS), which adheres to Weber's
law. This is a fancy way of saying that rats discriminate different quantities
based on their ratio, not their absolute difference. But despite these
interesting faculties, this experiment suggests that rats have no innate notion
of prime number. 

Secondly, this is another of many results contradicting behaviorist theory. Not
only do rats lack the capacity to figure out a prime number maze on their own,
but they cannot be taught to solve it. Though [rats are capable of rule-based
learning](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18369151/), prime numbers seem to
simply lie «beyond» the limits of their cognitive abilities. 

Lastly, a prime-maze is a computational problem and thus its solution can be
interpreted as a program. This allows us to express, at least heuristically,
that the rat's brain-hardware is incapable of implementing it.

[Another interesting study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4296930/pdf/xan_41_1_91.pdf) suggests that apparently geometric,
abstract learning in rats is in fact more concrete than it may seem. The
researchers successfully trained rats to find a submerged platform in a
pool using the length of the walls (e.g., \"the platform is in the
middle of the long wall\"). Then the researchers changed the color of
the walls—an obviously non-geometric property—only to find that the
rats' ability to find the platform was gone. This finding suggests that
the rats never acquired an abstract understanding of *length*, separate
from all sensory context, but rather formed a concrete and integrated
representation of the problem such as «platform-at-long-*black*-wall».

However, the fact that the rat, the worm and the mosquito all live, so
to speak, in different worlds, is neither a scientific problem nor a
problem for science. Science is objective, but not in the sense of
describing the world *as-is* (la *cosa-en-sí*, como leeríamos en
Schopenhauer): as I have tried to suggest, the Schopenhauerian thesis
that the world is representation is correct. Recall that Nietzsche
claims science is subjective not in terms of the individual, but of the
human condition, i.e. it is subjective in contrast to whatever science
another cognitively capable species could hypothetically produce.
Science is objective when understood within the human domain, and in the
traditional sense of basing itself upon impartial analysis of the facts[^3].
That these facts are not purely given but rather elaborated by our
representational faculties poses no problem, since these faculties are shared
and these facts appear more or less the same to everyone.

As a note, I don't think it is controversial to claim that our representational
faculties are shared and that facts appear more or less the same to everyone.
Cultural and psychological predispositions may influence the way we
interpret the facts, may not their appearance. When I see a painting of Christ I
see a Jew from Nazareth who lived a virtuous life two thousand years ago; a
fellow Christian sees the son of God. But no one can deny our sensory experience
is, *mutatis mutandis*, the same.

With regard to Nietzsche's claim that reason is tautological and
self-referencing, I believe it is only partially correct. It is certainly true
that formal disciplines are completely tautological, which is, by the way, an
uncontroversial statement (see for instance Russell's work *Human knowledge*).
Furthermore, formal structures are typically used as extremely simple and
abstract models of real systems. However tautological the deductions derived
from a model may be, the truths they uncover about the represented system are
less trivial than Nietzsche lets on. Take, for instance, the famous example of
the seven bridges of Königsberg, which inspired Euler to found graph theory.

Interestingly, formal disciplines take us back to the matter of innate
representations. It is generally accepted that some foundational
concepts of logic and mathematics lack any clear definition. The
paradigmatic example is the notion of *set*. Ever since Russell's
paradox showed the contradictions contained in naive set theory,
axiomatic set theories were developed to overcome such paradoxes without
arriving at a clear, universally accepted definition of the notion. One
is tempted to infer from this that, though mathematics operates by
necessity in tautological fashion, some of its foundational concepts
correspond to categories of thought which are embedded in our cognitive
faculties, however much we struggle to define them. It is certainly the
case that our biological endowment includes categories such as «number»,
«set», etc. This «innatist» view—for lack of a better term—may be
supported by certain interpretations of Gödel's incompleteness theorems,
which prove the existence of true but unprovable statements in any
sufficiently complex formal system. Even within formal systems,
something quite beyond the grasp of formal computation is involved in
their semantics.

With regard to non-formal disciplines, we must understand Nietzsche's
description of the fraught taxonomist, who defines a mammal and then
declares every new mammal he finds to be a discovery, with precision. To
contradict it, it is not sufficient to claim that scientists do not posit
aprioristic definitions and then search for instances of them. Nietzsche's point
is more subtle, since he suggests that the nature of language renders any
definition a lie—in a nonmoral sense, as the title of the work suggests. In
other words, to Nietzsche it is fundamentally impossible not to act as the
fraught taxonomist: whenever we speak, let alone postulate a definition, we are
necessarily weaving a metaphor or a myth. And it is unjustified to then claim
such metaphor corresponds to this or that objective instance.

I must admit that I do not find this point to be so convincing. To describe
language as a lie, to claim that speaking the truth is nothing but uttering the
correct metaphor, is somewhat simplistic. Nietzsche commits a common error among
philosophers in treating language like an abstract faculty, when in fact it
should be viewed as a faculty not different in kind from the visual or the
auditory systems. Nietzsche's claim that language is a lie is not different from
the claim that, when seeing a moving object, we don't perceive a pure object but
some impure elaboration of it. I don't mean to say that language does not have
distinct and particular properties, but rather that the *kind* of relationship
upon which Nietzsche bases his critique of language is not different from that
of other human faculties. It follows from this that we should care about the
fact that every word is a lie, in Nietzsche's sense, just as much as we should
care about the fact that every visual perception is an illusion. Of course it
is, but insofar as this «illusion» is what we denote by *real*, we must reckon
that treating it as merely illusory is contradictory.

Of course, one must understand that Nietzsche was arguing against a less
flexible conception of science than the one we have today. Primitive science—say
in the form of a Francis Bacon or a Darwin—understood the senses as more or less
trustworthy recipients of an objective reality. The intellect's task was merely
to explain it. Now, the very faculties upon which our representation of reality
is based are understood as constitutive parts of that reality, just as much as
the tree or the rock. In other words, our representational faculties are now
part of what requires an explanation. The circularity here is not only
unavoidable but unsolvable. The commonplace that neuroscience is «the brain
looking at itself» is true, and whatever we can learn about ourselves is limited
by that which we are trying to learn about. 

Here, the brain-computer analogy comes in handy. As far as I can see, this
heuristic makes sense only if we set conscious processes and cognitive faculties
to play the role of the interface provided by the kernel, unconscious processes
to play the role of the kernel, and the hardware playing the role of the brain.
Whoever is familiar with operating systems appreciates how profoundly different
these three spheres are, and how little information a level provides to its more
abstract successor. Since brains are tremendously more complex than any computer
system, this should readily suggest how unfathomable the gulf between our
cognitive faculties and the underlying brain processes must be.

In fact, we have concrete examples of how remote from each other interface,
kernel and hardware are in our own species. Visual experience, for instance,
though complex, does not begin to approximate the complexity of its underlying
neurobiology. Both the unconscious computations involved as well as its
biological substrate are incomprehensibly more complex than the experience
itself. What is more, the visual system itself is incapable of introspection:
one cannot «see» how the visual system works, and we can only expect that the
same applies to all cognitive faculties. Interfaces are the product of Darwinian
evolution, and I cannot imagine an environment in which natural selection pushes
not only for the emergence of a particular faculty but *also* for its
self-referential transparency. It is therefore conceivable that many aspects of
our own nature are ultimately unfathomable to us. 

I have little else to say on the matter. I should reiterate how profound I
believe Nietzsche's insights to be on this matter, regardless of finding myself
at odds with a few of them. With some fortune, I hope to have shown why I
believe we have no clear notion of *physical*, that we have rid ourselves not of
the ghost in the machine but rather of the machine itself, that science supports
the claim that, in Schopenhauer's terms, the world is our representation, and
that this does not pose a problem to scientific objectivity.

I should wish to end this entry recalling the verses that Calderón de la
Barca, whom Schopenhauer read in Spanish, wrote on this matter:

> ¿Qué es la vida? Un frenesí.<br>
> ¿Qué es la vida? Una ilusión,<br>
> una sombra, una ficción,<br> 
> y el mayor bien es pequeño:<br> 
> que toda la vida es sueño,<br>
> y los sueños, sueños son.

[^1] In *How to make our ideas clear*, Peirce uses the concept of
*force* as a paradigmatic example of an idea which is to be understood
only through the effects which it produces. His discussion is highly
stimulating and worth reading.

[^2] This interpretation of Newtonian physics is put forward in a
summarized, but in my view still convincing fashion, in Chomsky's short
work *What kind of creatures are we?*

[^3] A post-modern critique of science may object to this impartiality. I do not
take such objections too seriously, since they typically rest on a complete
misunderstanding of what scientific objectivity means. But this is not the place
to discuss this.
