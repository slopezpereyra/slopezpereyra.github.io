A profoundly thought-provoking work of Nietzsche, often overlooked, is the small
essay entitled *On truth and lies in a nonmoral sense*. This was the first truly
intelligent critique of science which I read, and, in all of its brevity, one
that has very rarely been matched.

I read this work at seventeen, when I was a young student at the
department of philosophy. Ten years later, today, with a few years of
experience in science and research, and close to graduating from the
department of mathematics, I read it again. What I write here may be
considered a commentary on this particular work, though I should strive
to provide more general observations on the nature of scientific
knowledge as I understand it.

The central thesis of this work, at least as far as I can see, is that
scientific theories are not representations of an objective reality, but
rather the subjective (and hence ultimately arbitrary) cognitive
elaboration of certain stimuli. (Here «subjective» does not refer to the
*individual* subject, but to the *human* subject.) To Nietzsche,
inferring objective properties from the result of any such stimulation
is unguaranteed:

> \[\...\] the further inference from the nerve stimulus to a cause
> outside of us is already a result of a false and unjustifiable
> application of the principle of sufficient reason.

The phrase «the stone is hard» expresses then the result of a subjective
feeling and not an objective «hardness» in the rock. A word is but the
formulation of a *qualitas occulta* underlying the infinite complexity
and multiplicity of that to which the word refers:

> Truths are illusions which we have forgotten are illusions; they are
> metaphors that have become worn out and have been drained of sensuous
> force, coins which have lost their embossing and are now considered as
> metal and no longer as coins.

Reason is understood at least partly as a self-referencing and
tautological instrument:

> If I make up the definition of a mammal, and then, after inspecting a
> camel, declare "look, a mammal," I have indeed brought a truth to
> light in this way, but it is a truth of limited value.

Furthermore, inquiry through science and reason is viewd as fundamentally
anthropocentric. Oblivious to the fact that in trying to describe reality «he
again proceeds from the error of believing that he has these things immediately
before him as mere objects», the scientist acts as the astrologers who treated
stars as agents in man's service:

> It is even a difficult thing for him \[the inquirer\] to admit to
> himself that the insect or the bird perceives an entirely different
> world from the one that man does, and that the question of which of
> these perceptions of the world is the more correct one is quite
> meaningless \[\...\]

If we could perceive matters «as a bird, now as a worm now as a plant, or if one
of us saw a stimulus as red, another as blue, while a third even heard the same
stimulus as a sound - then no one would speak of such a regularity of nature».
Quite pertinently, Nietzsche cites Pascal's famous passage on a labor man who
dreams each night that he's a king.

In my opinion, Nietzsche's insights are fundamentally correct. This early work
of his draws strongly from Schopenhauer's conception of the world as will and
representation, which I also deem fundamentally right. Such a thing as a purely
objective reality, a *ding an sich*, is not only unknowable but unimaginable.
Every species is endowed with more or less wide, but necessarily bounded
faculties of representation which are specific to it. Yet, contrarily to
believing that this undermines science, I would venture this itself constitutes
a scientific fact. Hopefully the reader will allow me to digress a bit in order
to bring forth my point.

For some reason, it is common to teach that the Newtonian revolution «overcame»
mind-body dualism by exorcising the ghost from the machine and providing a more
or less complete description of the physical world. This could not be further
away from the truth. Newtonian physics is based on the concept of *force*, which
serves to correctly explain nature, but which has no material ground. The
postulates of, say, gravitational force or electrostatic force proceed simply
from *observing* that distant (i.e. non-contacting) objects attract, repel and
generally influence each other. What distinguishes the gravitational and the
electrostatic force is simply the observed properties of this otherwise arcane
interaction. There is no understanding of what the word *force* means beyond
this.[^1]

In this sense, the epithet *physical* is meaningless and serves a merely
honorific function, just like the epithet *real*. To say *the real
truth* is simply to say to truth, but with a certain emphasis; to say
*the physical world* is simply to say *the world*, with a certain
condecoration. We have no notion of what *physical* means and, instead
of ridding ourselves of the ghost in the machine, Newton destroyed the
machine and left us with the ghost alone. [^2]

Furthermore, it is correct to claim that what we call *reality* is a
specific representation, and, to repeat Nietzsche's words, that

> \[\...\] the further inference from the nerve stimulus to a cause
> outside of us is already a result of a false and unjustifiable
> application of the principle of sufficient reason.

We can safely say certain stimuli are processed so and so, and acquire a
rather sophisticated understanding of the underpinnings of such
processing (as is the case, for instance, in the visual system). But we
are limited, both in the sight of a moving object as well as in our
description of the visual system itself, by the specific encoding which
our nervous system imposes upon the external world. A trivial corollary
of this is that human understanding has limits. It is conceivable that
our brains are simply ill-prepared to grasp certain properties of the
world—and I suspect philosophers are correct when suggesting that
mental phenomena may depend on some of such properties.

Take, for instance, the cognitive faculties of rats, a matter of
thought-provoking research. Though able to learn highly intricate mazes,
rats cannot learn to traverse a prime-maze, i.e. a maze with
$i=1,\ldots, N$ turns which is solved by the program:
$\textbf{if } i \textbf{ is prime turn right
else turn left}$. This suggests three interesting things with regards to
the way in which «reality» relates to our innate, limited
representational faculties.

 

Firstly, rats [seem to posses some sense of numerosity](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/6/8/46) directed by what
is technically termed the approximate number system (ANS), which adheres
to Weber's law. This is a fancy way of saying that rats
discriminate different quantities based on their ratio, not their
absolute difference. Even so, the experiment suggests that rats have no
innate notion of prime number. Secondly, this is another (of at this
point infinitely many) results contradicting behaviorism. Not only do
rats lack the capacity to figure out a prime number maze on their own,
but they can't be taught to solve it. Though [rats are capable of
rule-based learning](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18369151/), prime numbers seem to be «beyond» the limits
of their cognitive abilities. Lastly, a prime-maze is a computational
problem and thus its solution can be interpreted as a program. This
allows us to express, at least heuristically, that the rat's
brain-hardware is incapable of implementing it.

[Another interesting study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4296930/pdf/xan_41_1_91.pdf) suggests that apparently geometric,
abstract learning in rats is in fact more concrete than it may seem. The
researchers successfully trained rats to find a submerged platform in a
pool using the length of the walls (e.g., \"the platform is in the
middle of the long wall\"). Then the researchers changed the color of
the walls—an obviously non-geometric property—only to find that the
rats' ability to find the platform was gone. This finding suggests that
the rats never acquired an abstract understanding of *length*, separate
from all sensible context, but rather formed a concrete and integrated
representation of the problem such as «platform-at-long-*black*-wall».

However, the fact that the rat, the worm and the mosquito all live, so
to speak, in different worlds, is neither a scientific problem nor a
problem to science. Science is objective, but not in the sense of
describing the world *as-is* (la *cosa-en-sí*, como leeríamos en
Schopenhauer): as I have tried to suggest, the Schopenhauerian thesis
that the world is representation is correct. Recall that Nietzsche
claims science is subjective not in terms of the individual, but of the
human condition, i.e. it is subjective in contrast to whatever science
another cognitively capable species could hypothetically produce.
Science is objective understood within the human domain, and in the
traditional sense of basing itself upon impartial analysis of the
facts[^3]. That these facts are not purely given but rather
elaborated by our representational faculties poses no problem, since
said faculties are shared and these facts appear more or less the same
to everyone.

I could be accused of bigotry when supposing that our representational
faculties are shared and that facts appear more or less the same to
everyone. I do not deny that cultural and psychological predispositions
influence the way we interpret the facts. However, this is a matter of
interpretation, not of observation. When I see a painting of Christ I
see a Jew from Nazareth that lived a virtuous life two thousand years
ago; a fellow Christian sees the son of God. But no one can deny our
sensed experience is, *mutatis mutandis*, the same.

With regards to Nietzsche's claim that reason is tautological and
self-referencing, I believe it is only partially correct. It is
certainly true that formal disciplines are completely tautological,
which is by the way an uncontroversial statement (see for instance
Russell's work *Human knowledge*). Furthermore, formal structures are
typically used as extremely simple and abstract models of a real system,
and as tautological the deductions derived from the model may be, the
truths they uncover about the represented system are less trivial than
Nietzsche lets on. Take, for instance, the famous example of the seven
bridges of Königsberg, which inspired Euler to found graph theory.

Interestingly, formal disciplines take us back to the matter of innate
representations. It is generally accepted that some foundational
concepts of logics and mathematics lack any clear definition. The
paradigmatic example is the notion of *set*. Ever since Russell's
paradox showed the contradictions contained in naive set theory,
axiomatic set theories were developed to overcome such paradoxes without
arriving at a clear, universally accepted definition of the notion. One
is tempted to infer from this that, though mathematics operates by
necessity in tautological fashion, some of its foundational concepts
correspond to categories of thought which are embedded in our cognitive
faculties, however much we struggle to define them. It is certainly the
case that our biological endowment includes categories such as «number»,
«set», etc. This «innatist» view—for lack of a better term—may be
supported by certain interpretations of Gödel's incompleteness theorems,
which prove the existence of true but unprovable statements in any
sufficiently complex formal system. Even within formal systems,
something quite beyond the grasp of formal computation is involved in
their semantics.

With regards to non-formal disciplines, we must understand Nietzsche's
description of the fraught taxonomist, who defines a mammal and then
declares every new mammal he finds to be a discovery, with precision. To
contradict it, it is not sufficient to claim that scientist do not post
aprioristic definitions and then search for instances of them.
Nietzsche's point is more subtle, since he suggests that the nature of
language renders any definition a lie—in a nonmoral sense, as the
title of the work suggests. In other words, to Nietzsche it is
fundamentally impossible not to act as the fraught taxonomist: whenever
we speak, let alone postulate a definition, we are necessarily weaving a
metaphor or a myth. And it is unjustified to then claim such metaphor
corresponds to this or that objective instance.

I must admit that I don't find this point to be so convincing. To
describe language as a lie, to claim that speaking the truth is nothing
but uttering the correct metaphor, is somewhat simplistic. Nietzsche
commits a common error among philosophers in treating language like an
abstract faculty, when in fact it should be viewed as faculty not
different in kind from the visual or the auditory systems. Nietzsche's
claim that language is a lie is not different from the claim that, when
seeing a moving object, we don't perceive a pure object but some impure
elaboration of it. I don't mean to say that language does not have
distinct and particular properties, but rather that the *kind* of
relationship upon which Nietzsche bases his critique of language is not
different from that of other human faculties. It henceforth follows that
we should care about the fact that every word is a lie, in Nietzsche's
sense, just as much as we should care about the fact that every visual
perception is an illusion. Of course it is, but insofar as this
«illusion» is what we denote by *world* we must reckon that treating it
as such leads to a contradiction.

I have little else to say on the matter. I should reiterate how profound
I believe Nietzsche's insights to be on this matter, regardless of
finding myself at odds with a few of them. With some fortune, I hope to
have shown why I believe we have no clear notion of *physical*, that we
have rid ourselves not from the ghost in the machine but rather from the
machine itself, that science supports the claim that, in Schopenhauer's
terms, the world is our representation, and that this does not pose a
problem to scientific objectivity.

I should wish to end this entry recalling the verses that Calderón de la
Barca, whom Schopenhauer read in Spanish, wrote on this matter:

> ¿Qué es la vida? Un frenesí.<br>
> ¿Qué es la vida? Una ilusión,<br>
> una sombra, una ficción,<br> 
> y el mayor bien es pequeño:<br> 
> que toda la vida es sueño,<br>
> y los sueños, sueños son.

[^1] In *How to make our ideas clear*, Peirce uses the concept of
*force* as a paradigmatic example of an idea which is to be understood
only trough the effects which it produces. He's discussion is highly
stimulating and worth reading.

[^2] This interpretation of Newtonian physics is put forward in
summarized, but in my view still convincing fashion, in Chomsky's short
work *What kind of creatures are we?*

[^3] A post-modern critique of science may object to this
impartiality. I don't take such objections too seriously, since they
typically rest on a complete misunderstanding of what scientific
objectivity means. But this is not the place to discuss this.
