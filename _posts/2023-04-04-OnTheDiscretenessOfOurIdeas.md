Assume, for the moment, that every idea is a distinct object, defined by its
content and its particular relation to other ideas. Any set of ideas, under this
perspective, conforms a discrete an ordered set, the complexity of which a is a
reflection of the richness in their connections. (It makes no difference to
discuss whether the relation between ideas is inherent to their content, and
thus independent of our perception of them, or rather determined by our
perception of them. Such discussion falls in the same category as the falling
tree that no one hears.)

Since, under this view, any group of ideas is a discrete and ordered set, the
whole of our ideas on any particular subject has an associated Hasse diagram.
Such diagram shows the order-related properties of our conception of the
matter. For example, a lattice would result of a conception such that no pair of
ideas was left unconnected both to common premises and common conclusions, or at
least to common antecedents and consequents —a reflection of elaborated thought. 

Furthermore, a complemented lattice would be such that to every idea there is a
corresponding complementary opposite: an independent conception that nonetheless
arrives at the same conclusion. In other words, a complemented lattice is
associated to those sets of ideas where independent trains of thought flow from
the elementary to the conclusive thoughts.

This general conception has its pragmatic complement in the Zettelkasten
note-taking system. Such system consists of writing short, individual ideas in
separate entries and encoding them with only two properties: an arbitrary form
of identification, and a list of all ideas to which that idea associates. The
result is —once more— a discrete set of connected elements. A partially ordered
set, sensible to many a variety of graph representations.

The essential property of the above conception is that it allows for a general
thought structure to arise by itself. One is free to consider atomic ideas with
little regard to a general conception of the subject, and concerned only with
observing, upon elaborating an atomic thought, to which few other atoms such
thought is bonded. This microscopic approach to thought builds up to produce
elaborate systems of interconnected elements, which one discovers only when
sufficient individual atoms have been deposited. A structure is not imposed on
the matter of our inquiry, but rather allowed to emerge autonomously, and to
appear before us after the slow accumulation of individual, bonded elements, as
an inherent and *uncovered* property. It is, so to speak, a *generative*
approach to thought organization.

I am obliged to clarify a point with regards to those assumptions without which the
whole of our conception falls apart. To conceive a set of ideas as a partially
ordered set, with an associated Hasse diagram, one must regard the connection
between ideas to be reflexive, transitive, and anti-symmetric. While reflexivity
and transitivity are naturally granted, anti-symmetry is not an obvious
property. Who is to say, if a certain idea $\pi$ connects to a different idea
$\tau$, that $\tau$ can not in turn be connected to $\pi$? In fact, such seems
to be the general case. The idea "the abolishment of private ownership of
the means of production is good" connects to "capitalist production is
based on unfair exploitation", but the latter connects to the first just as
naturally.

However, this confusion is a consequence of our loose use of the term
"connects". So far, we have implicitly conceived any set of ideas to be
*directed*: a train of thought following from minimal ideas *towards*
intermediate and final ideas. So it becomes clear that to say "the idea $\pi$
connects to the idea $\tau$", or $\pi \preceq tau$, is to speak of a very
determined kind of connection, which one may term "begets", "suggests",
"implies", etc. 

In some cases, such as our example above, $\pi \preceq \tau$ and $\tau \preceq
\pi$ will only express a difference in the order in which the particular thread
was was formed in our minds. In other cases, such as inferences or deductions,
$\pi \preceq \tau$ and $\tau \preceq \pi$ are semantically incompatible unless
$\pi = \tau$. An example of this are the ideas "All man are mortal and Socrates
is a man", on one hand, and "Socrates is mortal". (I should emphasize that our
conception is not particularly concerned with syllogisms, especially insofar as
it is not concerned with individual propositions, since any particular idea is
allowed to be an arbitrarily complex set of propositions.)

We can, of course, dispose of the assumption of anti-symmetry (which would imply
the ascription of a different meaning to the term "connects" ($\preceq$)). In
doing so, we abandon the universe of partially ordered sets, and hence of Hasse
diagrams, but we can still conceive an arbitrary set as a graph. The structure
of the general conception would still be an emergent property of the individual
ideas. I venture that some sets of ideas —for example, ethical ideas— are
necessarily partially ordered sets (i.e., necessarily anti-symmetric). But this
is not the place to elaborate on this opinion.
