Among modern conventional practices, the use of social media presents two
characteristics which, both taken together as well as separately, are somewhat
peculiar. The first is that people are typically not uninclined to question it,
with many even recognizing it as superficial or even pernicious. The second is
that, despite being widely recognized at least as problematic, people find it
almost unthinkable to abstain from it, and even consider those who do so to be
eccentric at best, perhaps even suspicious.

One would not expect the abstention from social media platforms to be
so rare, since these are so frequently challenged. To take a single example, TikTok
is under constant scrutiny by government and human rights organizations. The
European Comission found it to have an addictive design and promote compulsive
behavior [[1]], and the Algorithmic Transparency Institute, in collaboration with
Amnesty International's digital forensics team, showed how TikTok amplifies
harmful and even suicidal content to adolescent users [[2]]. Beyond official
inquiries, public opinion is open to accepting that the network raises
significant concerns. And this dual scrutiny, running from public opinion and
from official institutions, applies to all major social media platforms.

However, in my experience, persuading people of abandoning social media, or
getting them to consider this as a viable alternative, is extraordinarily
difficult. From non-monogamy and anarchism to ufology and anti-vaccine rhetoric,
almost any fringe belief system—be it rational or irrational, fact-based or
superstitious—encounters less social friction than abstention 
from social media. The fact that people usually recognize the evils of social
media usage and yet are so reluctant to even considering abstaining from it
indicates how deeply pervaded and needful of it they have become. In this, and
in many other ways, the use of social media resembles more the epidemic
emergence of an addictive substance than merely a conventional practice.


Social media networks possess all the typical evils of technology as delivered
by Silicon Valley's mega-corporations, which are public knowledge [[3]]. On one
hand, though people tend to believe advertisement to be a filling that
interrupts or is in-between the content, the exact opposite is the case:
advertisement *is* the content, whatever else is simply there to capture
our attention. Furthermore, aside from fostering tyranny, these platforms are
tyrannical themselves. A person scrolling through social media is constantly
subjected to stimuli they never chose, needed, and perhaps even wanted. Lastly,
people are not only turned into a product in the form ad consumers, but also
into an object of constant surveillance. Every interaction with the platform is
used as information to more precisely exploit their softer underbelly,
sophisticating the mechanisms designed to keep their attention captive. This is
what is euphemistically called «personalizing user experience».

These networks are designed to provide the illusion of control. A certain
degree of customization is allowed, and some privacy settings exist. However,
(a) the properietary nature of these networks makes it impossible to verify how
privacy is in fact protected, and (b) these settings are typically limited—as
famously shown by Facebook's policy of keeping data even from deleted accounts.
Here, the user is put in a position analogous to that of a slave which is free
to choose the color of his clothes or a prisoner free to change his cell's
wallpaper patterns.

It should be clear that this is a matter of necessity: due to the very nature of
these platforms, any form of user control *must* be illusory. The surrendering
of one's identity to public and private scrutiny is part of their fundamental
design. This means that any use of them which discloses no personal data defeats
its very purpose and is thus not likely to occur. The strategy of these networks
is therefore to avoid unnecessary violence: instead of stealing data, they aim
at *seducing* people into giving away their information, an art which they have
mastered to perfection.

The means of this seduction are the eternal flaws and miseries of us all.
Vanity, a desire to be seen, loneliness, greed, the longing for a sense of
community or belonging: all these are exploited so as to convince people to surrender
themselves into a distant, almost absolutely abstract master. In return for your
public and, more often than not, also private life—in exchange for accepting
to be bombarded by targeted advertising—in appreciation for displaying each and
every one of your softest spots, so that they may be used against you, you are
given spiritual pennies: the illusion of connection, stupid and ephemeral
content so that you may forget yourself for a while, and the miserable joy of
being seen. This is the Promethean interchange upon which social networks are
founded: you get «gifts of enlightenment and ease in exchange for some measure
of awe, gratitude, and deference to the technocratic elite that manufactures
them» [[3]].

Any structure of power which bases itself in tyranny, and whose subsistence
depends on fostering the lesser side of human condition, is repugnant and vile.
Instead of widening the horizons of human expression, social media networks
narrow our points of view, radicalize us into smaller and smaller communities of
like-minded individuals, and make us forget the human touch.

Could better social networks exist? As is usually the case with technology, social
networks when considered generally are morally neutral. It is their capitalist
design what perverts them. There are social media networks that are not
centrally owned by any private or state entity and which do not subject
their users to any form of control or surveillance. It goes without saying that
the latter condition requires the satisfaction of all others that
make a software free (as in *libre*, not as in *gratis*). Mastodon is a famous
such type of network, but even this one is a *niche*. Are these solutions
to the issues raised above?

The answer is yes and no. On one hand, decentralized and free social networks
are not tyrannical by design, and thus do not possess the inherent evils of
networks such as X or Instagram. However, they do not elude the
problems of lack of substance, induction of compulsive behavior, and
superficiality. In comparison with tyranny and surveillance, these issues are
minor, but it must still be asked: what purpose does a social network account
serve, even assuming it doesn't violate your freedom?

Most people, I think dishonestly, answer that social networks serve the purpose
of keeping them informed. We pay little attention to how profoundly sad this
statement is. The hidden assumption of such statement is that we are too lazy or
unconcerned to actively seek information ourselves, perhaps through more
substantial means. On the contrary, we prefer to be spoon-fed with offensively
small, simplified chunks of information, which may certainly contain a link to
more substantial articles, but which in all honesty we are unlikely to read.
Furthermore, the propaganda model (as described by Chomsky and Herman) is
essentially unaffected by social networks, insofar as these are platforms for
news outlets to disseminate their content, without the networks producing news
themselves. So it should be needless to explain, at least to those familiar with
the model, how profoundly corrupt the attitude of informing oneself through
social media is.

In any case, I do not think people seriously believe that social media is a
source of information. I rather suppose that this is a more or less socially
acceptable justification for using them. The real reasons, I believe, are more
superficial. They draw our minds away from real life. We all seem to have a
profound desire, perhaps even a need, to be distracted. This is an urge that
perhaps should not always be resisted, but certainly should be well directed.
I have nothing against leisure and distraction *per se*, and in fact I am a
terribly lazy and disperse individual. What is more, I believe people
should have even more spare time than contemporary society allows for. As Jung
put it, we are a question addressed to the world, and we are to produce an
answer lest the world produce one for us. Our spare time is the opportunity we
have to connect with the creative, enriching facets of our own personal life, as
well as the time we have to connect with each other. Thus, it is clear that the
problem is not that we wish to be distracted, but where do we direct our
distraction. Since social media networks are by design addictive and inducing
of compulsive behavior, it is no surprise that most people waste their leisure
scrolling. They should feel every such minute as a *theft*, for no instant of
our life ever returns.

We underestimate how profoundly promising boredom is. The opportunity to be
bored is indeed a privilege. It is when we are bored that we feel inclined to
seek more rewarding experiences from life. The compulsion induced by social
networks of course exploits this natural inclination by providing us a rapid,
albeit shallow satisfaction. It is when I am bored that I decide to read, that I
decide to learn a music sheet, that I decide to write, that I decide to spend
time with a lover or a friend. Assuming a decent
standard of living, life is never short of opportunities to explore creative,
intellectual or affective satisfaction. Boredom is the catalyst that triggers
our pursuit of them.

Yet less and less we are able to endure boredom, and the quality of our lives
degrades in proportion. The shallow, rapid satisfaction which social networks
provide, in depriving us from the opportunity to learn, to explore and to
grow—in robbing us of our spare time, I mean—produces intellectual and moral
stagnation. I do not claim it makes us more stupid—though an argument can be
made—but at least it leaves us equally ignorant as before and hinders our
potential. The use of social media is perhaps not a root cause of
superficiality—be it intellectual or moral—but it certainly is a factor that not
only makes it more permanent, but also tinges it with a rather distinctive tone.

What is there to be done? The answer is so simple that I am amazed it's not
generally followed. We should abstain from using social media in any significant
way. This could be understood as a boycott, but I view it simply as an
abstention to partake in a practice that is tyrannical at worst, superficial and
stupefying at best. We must only come to a simple, straightforward realization:
we do not need social media. At least assuming you don't depend on them
professionally, there is no need they satisfy which cannot be satisfied in a
more healthy, meaningful and enriching way. We should learn to embrace boredom
precisely as what it is: a precious and delightful opportunity—and we should
vindicate a form of human relations more sincere and honest than that which is
practised in social media.
