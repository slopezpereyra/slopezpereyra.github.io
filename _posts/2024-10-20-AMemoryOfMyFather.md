title: A memory of my father

The night falls deep: I sense the moonlight with my heart. Once more, I cannot
sleep. What troubles me are these pearls, these little devils: *memories*.
Though taking many forms, like ill-intended water, a face, a name, a man always
appears. His eyes are a thousand eyes, his face is a thousand faces, his soul
is a thousand souls. Love and storm-born passions, tranquility and vengeance, obscurity
and kindness, weariness and hope: these are his avatars. 

One memory, in particular, comes to me, conjured through the mystic fingers of 
the night. L and I are I are swimming in a hostile summer day. At sunset we
head back to my house. Again, as it was usual in the hellish summers, we have
no electricity. A familiar dilemma is faced: Open the windows and allow the
nightly breeze to flow, but with it the innumerable mosquitoes; keep the
windows closed, the plague at bay, and bare the heat. And then his voice 
appears.

As if from another world, my father calls us in from his room in the second
floor. In the little terrace, three mattresses are lined up next to one
another. Above them, because we are far from the city and there are no lights
during the blackout, a myriad of stars of every color blaze. The breeze is strong
enough to keep the mosquitoes away. As we all lie there, in the terrace,
without blankets or pillows, my father begins to speak: \textit{Those are the}
Tres Marías, \textit{that is } Orión... And so we fall asleep.
