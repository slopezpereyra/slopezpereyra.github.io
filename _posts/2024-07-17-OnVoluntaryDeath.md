When I was seventeen, I visited the Ranakpur Jain Temple. I learned there of a
curious practice not uncommon to this day. Jain monks live a life of silent
asceticism. Some of them, upon reaching supreme emancipation, abandon
themselves to meditation and into disintegration by means of inanition.

During the same trip, I visited the Jaisalmer Fort, built in the dawn of
the second millennia after Christ. During the thirteenth century,
succumbing to the siege of the invader Alauddin, while all the
women and children committed *Jahuar*—a ritual practice of mass
self-immolation—the few surviving men left the fort to die in battle.

Gödel, who was paranoid, died of inanition out of fear of someone poisoning his
food. Yukio Mishima, that exquisite writer, practiced *seppuku* when his
attempted *coup d'état* failed. Cato de Younger sought death in similar
fashion: defeated by Caesar, he plunged his sword into his chest and tore his
bowels with his hands. Seneca died a slow and bureaucratic death by command of
Nero. The Bolivian agent who executed Che Guevara reported his last words to
be: *Serénese y apunte bien: va a matar a un hombre*. Socrates, out of respect
to a ruling which he knew unfair, declined to be released by his friends; when
the time came, he drank the hemlock calmly, and his farewell thought was of a
debt he didn't want to leave unpaid. Lucan considered death so precious that he
though unfair that everyone could die.

The core of the Christian *ethos* is the willingness to die. God itself became
incarnate so as to suffer earthly death. Origen of Alexandria endured two years
of torture under Decius: he deemed death a lesser evil than abandoning his
faith. The Bible agreed with him: in *Mark 14:31* Peter tells Jesus: *If I
should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise*. In *Chronicles 1:10*
we are told that, defeated by the Philistines, 

> Saul said to his armourbearer: Draw thy sword, and thrust me through
> therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armourbearer
> would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.

Saint Hilary of Poitiers, as he was in Syria, learned that his only daughter
was pretended by many wealthy and powerful men. Inspired by the idea that no
marriage was better for her than one with God, he fervourously prayed for her  
death. Curiously enough, she died, and he rejoiced in her passing. His wife,
who also found bliss in her daughter's union with God, asked him to pray for
her death as well. And soon after she died a death of mutual satisfaction.[^1]

Though we feel certain inclination to regard voluntary death as unnatural, it
is in fact surprising how decisively a person can rid itself of the will to
live or embrace the will to die. From a certain perspective, it makes little
sense that a biological being can dispose so readily of the will to perpetuate
its own existence. But, like an intelligent designer which bestow his creatures
with the faculty of rebellion, nature is complex enough as to produce agents
which may appear to contradict it. This is the root of the biblical tale, as
Milton put it:

> Because we freely love, as in our will<br>
> To love or not; in this we stand or fall:<br>
> And some are fall'n, to disobedience fall'n (...).

In desperate cases, as in the case of the women and children who committed
*Jahuar* in Jaisalmer Fort, voluntary death is the lesser evil. In what comes
to the ascetic surrender of Jain monks, I see that it prevents no evil nor it
produces any happiness. If anything, it seems to be a rather a pointless
endeavor to subject oneself to such unnecessary suffering. Asceticism in
general escapes my understanding. As Hesse's Siddhartha put it:

> And Siddhartha said quietly, as if he was talking to himself: \"What
> is meditation? What is leaving one's body? What is fasting? What is
> holding one's breath? It is fleeing from the self, it is a short
> escape of the agony of being a self, it is a short numbing of the
> senses against the pain and the pointlessness of life. The same
> escape, the same short numbing is what the driver of an ox-cart finds
> in the inn, drinking a few bowls of rice-wine or fermented coconut
> milk.\"


Since many faiths are worse than death, and death is not the worse of evils,
voluntary death cannot be universally wrong and must be judged according to the
circumstances of the case. It's true that most of us feel committed to life,
and do not wish to "go gentle into that good night". Yet the examples above
show that there is place for gentleness and even satisfaction in that eternal
close of day.
