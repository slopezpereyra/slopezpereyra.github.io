title: A reflection inspired by a small achievement

A few days ago, I got the acceptance letter for my first first-author
paper, which will be published in a *Nature* journal. Though
insignificant in the grand scheme of life, this is the culmination of three
years of work, done in simultaneous with my pursuit of a college degree—which I
don't yet have. I know the paper too thoroughly and well to consider it that
good: its flaws are too apparent to me. But regardless of what I think about the
paper, seeing what other people think about this «achievement» has made me
notice a few ironies in the way other people perceive our own failures and
successes.

Since my early adolescence, I had been constantly questioned and doubted by all
around me, except perhaps my father. I was deemed at best a lazy and
low-achieving adolescent, at worst an arrogant rascal. I was repeatedly told by
my elder brother and sister that I had no future—comments which were undoubtedly
motivated by bitter grudges rooted in the chaotic history of my family—and this
opinion was more tacitly entertained by almost everyone else. Now I suspect they
*wanted* me to fail, because I had been the only one who «left» to accompany my
father after his divorce, and any failure of my own was seen as proving he was
not fit to raise me. I *had* to fail so that they could enjoy a morbid form of
vengeful satisfaction.  

My terrible performance at school gave everyone ample ground for
pseudo-justifications. I was an incorrigibly irreverent young man who
deemed—correctly, I should say, but irrelevantly so—that my avid devotion to
reading accounted for more of an education than a professor dispassionately
spelling out Bhaskara's formula. I was many times reprimanded for reading during
class; a volume of Euripides was confiscated from me once by the professor of
«Ethical and civic training»; and once, as I read *Das Kapital* during the class
of mathematics, my professor shouted at me «never have I had a student that read
so much and did so poorly!».

When exam periods came, I took none of them, but arrogantly handed blank papers
in and sat there reading. The only exceptions were the few courses of my
interest, such as history, geography, and literature, in which I did very well
and was very well esteemed by professors. This «policy» was of course untenable
and I had to finish my last year of high-school in an accelerated school, the
only one who took limit cases like myself. There I continued freely to read
devotely, all among «problem children», students which struggled with addiction
or violence, and even a sweet fifty-five year old woman who had never finished
high-school.

When I started college at seventeen years old, I decided to pursue a career in
the humanities, a decision which was deemed short-sighted and immature,
certainly due to its lack of a financially prosperous prospect. In any case,
this short-sightedness, as was clearly pointed out to me, fell in great
accordance with my feeble aspirations and potential in life, and at least we
could be grateful that I had finished high-school.

It is easy to shrug at these things now, with a stern or gracious face, but
during adolescence this lack of affirmation was harshly felt. However much I
faked indifference, these judgments affected me to the point that they became a
sort of self-fulfilling prophecy. I was taught I was irresponsible and hopeless,
and I took this lesson to heart. Importantly, any intellectual or artistic
sensibility I could have would not correct this belief, for the universal
agreement was that I was «somewhat intelligent and fond of books» but «too
lackadaisical to make any use of these advantages». It certainly didn't help my
case that, even though I did always well in university, I changed degrees many
times and had a tremendously difficult time finding my purpose in life.

It says a lot that my life turned around not due to a realization brewed within
me, sourced from some inner well of meaning, but because I found a person—one
far more pure than those which life had placed before me up to that point—which
simply believed in me. It would be cooler, I suppose, to feign indifference and
say that what others think doesn't matter to me—the truth is I clearly needed
someone to believe in me.

The years went by, I straightened up, and went to accomplish things which,
however small I deem them, are socially considered difficult, prestigious or
important. I am too aware of my own flaws to let this bloat my ego. After defeat
or triumph, nothing of ourselves is transformed, and Kipling was right in
suggesting these «impostors» ought to be equally treated. But there is something
to be learnt from the way those who always undermined me look, or rather *don't*
look, at my achievements. It is all well summed up in the phrase: *nobody
cares*. Those former judges, who would have deemed it unconceivable that I
become a scientist, don't seem even to remember how laboriously they had set out
to chip away at my self-esteem. Everyone shrugs indifferently, no-one recalls.

The lesson is too clear not to be drawn: it is a mistake to think one might be
able to disprove those who undermine us, to think a time will come when one
might say to them: «you were wrong». The kind of people who, as the song says,
«get their kicks stomping on a dream», typically do so with such casual
indifference that they do not even care enough to notice a refutation. One must
achieve not to deter or disprove indifferent enemies, but in recognition and
appreciation of those who love us. It would be easy to claim potential,
intelligence, discipline or hard study explain my eventual «reincarnation». If I
am strictly honest, and track my present state to its root cause, it's simply
genuine love. A girl appears before a young man—a very lonely one—and tells him
she believes in him: then everything around them blooms. There is a lesson there
as well.

Now I look at those old judges with eyes more mature. Most are blinded by the
pursuit of money, which is their only value; others have lost themselves, like
most people do, to self-betrayal; they grind and toil and crawl in a desperate
pursuit of accumulation. You will never hear them say a word of self-reflection,
all about them screams self-satisfaction. They have not turned their lives
around, because the world they've built is so crooked that they think they are
standing straight,

> sólo a su goce ruin y medro atentos,<br>
> y no al concierto universal.

And so, like Martí said, some prey upon the souls of others, some give their
souls to nourish even the ones who prey upon them,

> tal como el hierro frío en las entrañas<br>
> de la virgen que mata se calienta.
