One of the finest acquisitions I have made is an edition by the University of
Michigan of the extraordinary *Ballads* collected by Francis James Child. I was
first made aware of the existence of these ballads by the appearance of some of
them in Louis Untermeyer's *Albatross Book of Verse*, which I found perchance in
a second-hand library in Buenos Aires, at seventeen years of age, and which was
my first awakening to the world of English poetry.

Child's anthology contains poems of great antiquity and beauty, among which
[*Thomas the Rhymer*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_the_Rhymer)
fascinated me the most. The poem, in all its dreamlike strangeness, had one
particular characteristic which I found intriguing. It tells that Thomas the
Rhymer was forced upon the gift of prophecy—and this very much against his
will—by virtue of a mystical apple given to him by the «Queen of Elfland». The
gift of prophecy is but the «tongue that can never lie», and the traditional
commentary upon the ballad informs that the apple by virtue of which it is
acquired is taken from the fatal tree of knowledge. Thus, when the ballad reads
that *they came on to a garden green*, it means the Garden of Eden.

«Why—thought I—does the forbidden fruit, whose flavour is the root of death,
corruption and fallenness, endow not falsehood but a truthbound state?». The
Bible speaks of the «tree of knowledge of good and evil»,

> But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. —Genesis 2:9 (KJV)

and thus it is unsurprising that its fruit should bestow some form of
illumination. But why should it be the source of truthfulness? 

Classical commentary on the book of Genesis is not illuminating on this point.
For instance, Philo of Alexandria, whose work *Quaestiones et solutiones in
Genesim* I read with devotion in my early twenties, speaks thus on questions 15:

> Why does (God) say, when He commands (Adam) to eat of every
>tree which is in Paradise, ‘“‘Eat” in the singular number; but, when He forbids
>eating of the tree which gives knowledge of good and evil, says, in the plural
>number, ‘“‘Do not eat, for on the day when ye shall eat, ye shall die”?
>
>First, because though it extends over many things, the good is one, and not
>less for this reason, namely that He who gave the benefit is one, as is also
>the one who received the benefit. This ‘‘one’’ I speak of, not with reference
>to the number which precedes the number two, but with reference to the unitary
>power, in accordance with which many things are harmonized and agree and by
>their concord imitate the one, such as a flock, a herd, a drove, a chorus, an
>army, a nation, a tribe, a household, a city. For all these, extending over
>many, are one community and embrace lovingly ; but when they are unmixed and
>have nothing in common, they fall into duality and into a multitude and are
>divided. For duality is the beginning of division. But two who use the same
>philosophy as one enjoy an unadulterated and clear virtue which is free of
>evil. But when good and evil are mixed, they have as their beginning a mixture
>of death. 

Then, in question 40, he speaks thus of the discrimination brought upon by the
forbidden fruit:

> What is the meaning of the words, “‘For they knew that they were naked”’? 
> 
> It was of this, that is, of their own nakedness, that they first received
> knowledge by eating of the forbidden fruit. And this was opinion and the
> beginning of evil, for they had not used any covering, inasmuch as the parts
> of the universe 'are immortal and incorruptible'; but (now) they needed that
> which is made by hand and corruptible. And this knowledge was in being naked,
> not that it was in itself the cause of change, but that now a strangeness was
> conceived by the mind toward the whole world.

Origen of Alexandria, in his *Homilies on Genesis*, though extensively covering
the image of the fruit of the land in his characteristic allegorical manner,
speaks not once of the forbidden fruit nor of Eve's transgression.

John Chrysostom, on his 16th homily on Genesis, speaks briefly in terms closer
to our question when pointing out that Adam had already been granted the gift of
prophecy when he was created, along with absolute intelligence and knowledge.
However, he concludes from this that it is absurd that the fruit should bestow
any form of illumination. Rather, he says:

> But behold, they say, it was Scripture that called it the tree of the
> knowledge of good and evil. I know that, too: but if you are prepared to learn
> the characteristics of Sacred Scripture, you will know why it gave this name
> to the tree. You see, it wasn’t because it supplied knowledge that it is
> called that, but because (133a) the transgression of the command happened to
> concern the tree, and from that event knowledge of sin then entered the scene,
> and shame as well—that was why the name was given. It is, after all, the way
> with Sacred Scripture to name places from the things that happen, wherever it
> is they happen. So on this basis Sacred Scripture also named the tree of the
> knowledge of good and evil since transgression and observance of the command
> concerned the tree.

I found this explanation unsatisfactory and dogmatic. Far more interesting is
the interpretation of Gregory Nazianzen, in the 45th oration of his
*Orationes*, when he writes:

> This latter was the Tree of Knowledge; not, however, because it was evil from
> the beginning when planted; nor was it forbidden because God grudged it to men
> — let not the enemies of God wag their tongues in that direction, or imitate
> the serpent. But it would have been good if partaken of at the proper time;
> for the Tree was, according to my theory, Contemplation, which it is only safe
> for those who have reached maturity of habit to enter upon; but which is not
> good for those who are still somewhat simple and greedy; just as neither is
> solid food good for those who are yet tender and have need of milk.

To him the fruit does grant illumination, but one of which man must partake only
at the proper time, lest it may corrupt him. Gregory of Nyssa partly agrees when
he writes, in his work *On the making of man*:

> It speaks of the fruit of the forbidden tree not as a thing absolutely evil
> (because it is decked with good), nor as a thing purely good (because evil is
> latent in it) ...

However, the depiction closest to that of the ballad is Milton's, 
according to whom the Serpent spoke thus to Eve of the tree of science:


>O Sacred, Wise, and Wisdom-giving Plant,<br>
Mother of Science, Now I feel thy Power<br>
Within me cleere, not onely to discerne<br>
Things in thir Causes, but to trace the wayes<br>
Of highest Agents, deemd however wise.<br>
Queen of this Universe, doe not believe<br>
Those rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die:<br>
How should ye? by the Fruit? it gives you Life<br>
To Knowledge, By the Threatner? look on mee,<br>
Mee who have touch'd and tasted, yet both live,<br>
And life more perfet have attaind then Fate<br>
Meant mee, by ventring higher then my Lot.<br>

Not much later, Eve declares that the fruit gives «elocution to the mute, and
taught The Tongue not made for Speech to speak thy praise», and eating of it 
wishes to «grow mature in knowledge, as the Gods who all things know».

Does Eve's *hubris* contain the secret meaning of the ballad? Is the knowledge
which the fruit bestows so rich that it equates to that of *the Gods who all things
know*? And is this what Thomas was granted in his own incursion into the Garden
of Eden?

Another interpretation is possible, one more suited to explain the inability to
lie. It is conceivable that the fruit does not so much bestow knowledge as it
incarnates at least some aspect of the divine essence. If Thomas cannot lie, it
means one of two things: either he cannot speak what will not occur, or he can
freely speak, thus mastering faith. Perhaps, then, the power of the fruit would
be that of infusing into common language the creative power of the λόγος. To lie
becomes a metaphysical impossibility, for language is no longer a
representational faculty, but an ontological one. Adam and Eve's transgression
would not be then that of acquiring knowledge, but that of stepping into the
creative prerogative of the Word. 

In support of this interpretation, we have Saint Augustine's words in *De
Mendacio*, when he comments on the following judgment:

> The son that receives the word is far from perdition; receiving it, he
> receives it for himself and nothing false comes out of his mouth.

and identifies truth with God himself. Also, in the Gnostic tradition, at least
as presented in *The Secret Book of John*, it is Jesus himself who coaxes Eve to
eat of the tree of knowledge, and he also calls the tree «Epinoia (ἐπίνοια) of
light».
