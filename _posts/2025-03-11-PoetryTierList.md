#### Tier 0: Why do people read these guys?

- *Charles Bukowski*: The only appeal of this writer is the entirely adolescent
idea that there is something transgressive in using bad words and writing about
prostitutes, sex, alcohol abuse, and misanthropy. From a formal perspective he
is unmemorable; from a semantic one, he is simply bad.

- *Dámaso Alonso*: Not only a pedantic writer but a tasteless one. Among his
crimes we may count the following obscenity:

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.2;">
        Cabrïola en la cumbre de una ola;<br>
        ¡Hola, instante, deténteme un instante! <br>
        Instante, cuando vuelves el semblante,<br>
        ya no eres tú (ni yo el que dijo ¡hola!).<br>
    </div>
</div>

That stanza is sufficient argument.

- *Cortázar*: His stories are excellent, his poetry is really, *really* bad.

- *Luis Cernuda*: He's not as bad as his predecessors, but his fame is to me
unwarranted.

- *Luis de Góngora*: He shares a distasteful characteristic with Bukowski: not
only was he the practiser of a bad style, but the *founder* of one, in the sense
that many followed in his footsteps. *Gongorism* is perhaps the least agreeable
current in the whole tradition of Spanish poetry.

- *Baltasar Gracián*: This poet, though celebrated and famous, is so bad that
Borges wrote a [famous poem](https://ciudadseva.com/texto/baltasar-gracian/) about him.
The poem begins in satyric tone and ends in a mystically tragic one.

#### Tier 1: Acceptable or good

- *García Lorca*: Yes, Borges was right: he was a minor poet. Still, *Poeta en
Nueva York* (his best book) has some powerful poems. The rest of his work is
okay at best, hand-wavy at worst.

- *Rafael Alberti*: Decent poet with some good books.

- *Pablo Neruda*: His epic work *Canto General* is a marvelous piece which must
  be read. The rest of his work is okay with some bad works (like *Veinte
poemas de amor y una canción desesperada*).

- *Alfonsina Storni*: Good writer with some very nice poems.

- *Juana de Ibarbourou*: His book *Lenguas de diamante* is very good, but did
not leave such a definite impression in my memory.

- *Juan Ramón Jiménez*: Curiously, he won a Nobel prize for his worst work,
namely *Platero y yo*. Some of his poems are quite decent.

- *Vicente Aleixandre*: This author perhaps deserved to be in the next tier. He
  is very good from a semantic as well as from a formal perspective. 

- *Juan Gelman*: Some of his work is interesting, never fascinated me though.

- *William Longfellow*: This author has some very good poems and many
forgettable ones.

- *Ezequiel Martínez Estrada*: This is an interesting one. He is not known
outside of Argentina; in a formal sense, he used uncommon resources---e.g. wide
use of dodecasyllable verses and original rhythms---. From a semantic
perspective, he has some *really* memorable poems. For instance, the ending of a
poem dedicated to nature ends with the following exquisite stanza:

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.2;">
        Que en ti la angustia humana<br>
        sus herrumbres sacuda,<br>
        mundo que diste al buda  <br>
        la idea del Nirvana.<br>
    </div>
</div>

He is not in the next tier because, though counting some extraordinary poems,
he has many forgettable ones as well. 

- *Thomas Hardy*: Another author which perhaps deserved the following tier, but
  falls to the same sin as his predecessor: among the few unforgettable poems
there are countless forgettable ones. His poem *Ah, are you digging on
my grave?* threads in an exquisite line between dark humour and plain obscurity.
His poem *Afterwards* is one of the most exquisite examples of English
literature. *After the last breath* is another very fine poem. He has many other
very good poems.

- *Christina Rossetti*: She is okay.

- *Emily Dickinson*: Dickinson was a very fine writer very much worth reading.
Yet, she did not impress me as strongly as she did other people. This may be a
limitation on my end.

- *Pedro Salinas*: A very fine poet.

- *The Argensola brothers*: These are two writers but I group them into one.
They wrote some fine verses.

- *Fray Luis de León*: He has very good poems, and his translation of *El cantar
  de los cantares* is an exquisite reading.

- *José Pedroni*: Good poems.

- *Rubén Darío*: Good poems, though modernism always feels old fashioned.

- *Francisco de Quevedo*: Too baroque for a superior tier, but certainly a very
  good writer.

- *Oliverio Girondo*: Decent.

#### Tier 2: Excellent

- *César Vallejo*: An original and exquisite writer. 

- *William Wordsworth*:

- *Coleridge*:

- *Walt Whitman*:

- *José Martí*:

- *Kipling*: 

- *Garcilaso de la Vega*: His sonnets are very commendable.

- *Angelus Silesius*: He conveys god.

- *Roberto Juaroz*: Sadly he is not that read today.

- *Robert Frost*: Semantically, one of the very best.

- *William Blake*: Pure and unlimited originality, superlative quality.

- *Dylan Thomas*: My introduction to poetry in the English language and an
exquisite writer. *Do not go gentle into that good night* is a diamond, as well
as some of his lesser known poems (see, for instance, the masterpiece *Before I
knocked*).

#### Tier 3: Divine

- *Borges*: Needless to explain why.

- *Miguel Hernández*: This may surprise some people. However, his posthumous
work *Cancionero y romancero de ausencias* is *incredibly* good, with some of
its poems (e.g. *Sigo en la sombra, lleno de luz*) showing exquisite intuition,
perfect technique, and ineffable depth. His previous works are also very good,
except his first. His poems are sang by an almost totally unknown Spanish singer
who does them [an extraordinary
rendition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-zzlr3pThI&t=916s&ab_channel=DJ_Grifuz).
His work is very much tied to his biography, so it makes sense to study his life
as well is one is interested in his poems.
