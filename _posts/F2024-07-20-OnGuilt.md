title: On guilt 
category: [ Personal ]

Of all negative sentiments, guilt is perhaps the only one to be actively
encouraged by customary education. Thousands of children everyday are
forced to beat their chests and whisper:

> Through my fault, through my fault,<br>
> through my most grievous fault.

César Vallejo, in *Los heraldos negros*, describes the man riddled by tragedy
as one who's eyes betray his entire life as *un charco de culpa* (a puddle of
guilt). Everybody knows of Judas' faith, who cried: *I have sinned in that I
have betrayed the innocent blood*, and hanged himself. Dante, shortly after
entering the fourth circle, asks horrified: *Why do we let our guilt consume us
so?* And everybody knows the story of Oedipus, popularized by Freud, how
blinded himself out of guilt.

Yet, though guilt is familiar to everyone, it is intriguing to see how varied
are its causes among people. What makes a person guilty is in general as
revealing as what makes him joyful, and we would do good in inquiring upon this
matter when judging the moral integrity of people.

For instance, I once knew a man who carried a truly sinister weight,
having destroyed his family through acts of virulent hate. When I asked
what he felt guilty for, he gravely said a single thing still haunted
him to that day: That he wasn't all that nice to certain girlfriend of
his youth. In one of Guevara's diaries, he tells that a little dog which
accompanied his troops was about to get them killed: in a sudden burst
of barking, it was giving away their position. He and another soldier
had to silently asphyxiate the poor creature, which apparently caused
him such sorrow that he could never forget.

It seems indisputable to me that guilt induces no positive effect in the world.
The victim of a wrongdoing is in no way benefited if the author of it feels
guilty, nor the latter incurs in any reparation by drowning in remorse. We
should strive to amend the mistakes we can amend and forget those we cannot. 
This was perhaps what Borges meant when saying 

> *El olvido es la única venganza y el único perdón*

It is evident that guiltless world is preferable than its alternative.

There are, however, acts that one cannot forget. What is to be pursued in these
cases is restoration—and no amount of guilty feelings can have a restorative
effect. This, on its turn, inspires a moral principle more compassionate to our
defects and more in accordance with our natural flaws. Namely, that we should
not aspire for perfection, nor obey a universal imperative, but try that our
wrongdoings aren't so grave that a compassionate soul may be incapable of
forget them. Should this principle be satisfied, we could amend what can be
amended and forget what cannot be. If that limit is crossed, there is nothing
to advice, and perhaps there is nothing to be said but to recall Plauto's
words: *Nihil est miserius quam animus hominis conscius.* \[Nothing is more
miserable than the soul of a man conscious of guilt.\]
