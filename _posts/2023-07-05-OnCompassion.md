title: On compassion

Not long ago, I found online a person I met in my teenage years. Although I did
not know her well, she struck me at the time as a calm and quiet soul. A video
she made public was sent to me in a sarcastic tone. In it, she spoke of a group of women
she had joined. The people in this group, as she put it, "gifted each other
money", thus realizing an "alternative economy", which was
feminist "because the group consisted of women only" and defied the
mainstream capitalist dynamics. 

She went on to describe how, upon entering the group, a woman was of the fire
element, and thus proceeded to "burn her fears away"—while also
being obliged to give her money away to a member who had reached the element
of water. At some point, through some mechanism she made not clear, the one that
was fire was to become water and receive "that great abundance"
too. In short, in what seemed to me a desperate need for belonging, she had
fallen for a pyramid scheme. I later came to find she had sold most of her
things in order to meet the initial payment required for entering the group, and
that two years later she still awaits her time to become water—And although no
fire lasts that long, she trusts her time will come, and that abundance awaits.

She was also very caught up in what I can only term *pensamiento mágico*.
Every being is—she tells—the vibration of a spiritual substance—A ritual was to be held
involving the burning of pieces of paper with our fears written on
them—Everything she believed was a bizarre mixture of a conspiracy theory,
self-help books for bored women over fifty, and *duendology*
(duendología). In short, she seemed to have lost track of what was real, and to
be very lonely and credulous indeed. 

Although this content was sent to me with the purpose of making me laugh, I could
not help but to feel a tremendous compassion for her. I was reminded of a very dark
period of my life, which transpired about three years ago. The trigger is too
private to note here—suffices to say a tragedy in the most inner circle of my
family provoked a profound depression in me. Perhaps for the worst, at the time
I was studying the work of C.G. Jung, which was so suggestive in a mind as
vulnerable as mine was at the time, that I secluded myself to the examination of
my dreams. I came to learn that self-absorption is the finest ally of anguish.
In what I now deem a desperate attempt at staying in touch with at least an
abstract form of reality, and escape that universe grim and bleak which my
interior life became, I gave myself to the study of chess with almost obsessive
devotion. My only happiness at the time came from this solitary diversion, and
from the study of mathematics, which I struggled to sustain with the same
vehemence and exertion with which even the lowest forms of life strive to
preserve their petty selves. 

One must be very lost indeed when chess and mathematics, which are everywhere
held to be the precursors of madness, are one's anchors. Whatever the case, I
hardly remember anything of that period in my life. When I think of it, two
things only stand out: a profound solitude, which nothing could ever break, and
a sadness as deep as I have ever felt. Everything else is fuzzy and
irrecoverable in my memory.

I was reminded, too, that at this time I came quite close to Christianity. A
stranger may think it stupid, perhaps even insulting, to take Christianity as
similar to the magic ideas that seized the mind of this old acquaintance. 
But whoever knows me personally will understand the comparison is
not far from true. I have never received any religious education. I have not
been baptized. I read the bible in my twenties and merely out of literary
pleasure. And not only was I not religious: I was a committed atheist. 

I spoke then with two friends of mine. One is a devoted Christian, who had
studied Spanish literature in New York, specializing in the Catholic writers of
the *Siglo de oro*. The other is a former Christian that converted to
Islam and leads a highly religious life—at the time he was still a Christian
and was quite close to becoming a friar in the Dominican roder. I came to both
of them with a single, unique question: how was faith brought about. I
distinctly remember *wanting* to believe—so desperate was I—but I
couldn't find a way to do so. I will avoid any detailed discussion on this:
suffices to say their answers did not convince me. I eventually
regained my strength and became my normal self, and these religious concerns
became once more a matter of cultural diversion only. And here, pondering on
this biographical considerations, I found the source of my compassion. 

I came to think: No one is so blessed, so exempted from misfortune, that he may
not fall for desperate answers when faced with desperate questions. It is a
repeated stoic idea that fortune is the master of us all—but it is also a true
one. A few weeks ago, I found the word *weird* in an English ballad from
the 12th century—but it was used in a strange way. Upon consulting the
etymology of the word, I found that *weird*, from the Anglo-saxon
*Wyrd*, meant *faith, fatum, destino*. The *Weird sisters*
were the Norns of Scandinavian mythology, as accounted I think by Snorri
Sturluson. These three goddesses spin the threads of fate in a manner inexorable
to men. Who is to say what is being woven for himself? I may find that old
acquaintance strange, her ideas ridiculous, her credulity even silly—but how
many misfortunes split the distance from her fantastic confusion and my sober
tranquility? Am I so soundly fixed in my equanimity that a simple struck of
faith could not drive me too into that peculiar solitude—that very modern
solitude—that frequently forebears the fantasies and anguishes of contemporary
forms of magic—that is so fundamental to madness and despair? 

Whoever can't imagine a thousand faiths by which to be devolved, degenerated, or
lost—whose blow would drive us stupid, confused, suggestible, or
crazy—whoever can't see himself in the credulous, the silly, and the
weak—that person ignores how fragile is the fabric of which our souls are
made, and takes for iron what is clay, and mistakes character with fortune.

Furthermore, when I compare myself to her, and examine what it is that makes us
different—more yet, what it is that makes her laughable and not me before
to the common eye—I find that it is a set of, I concede, positive and
desirable traits, but none of which is truly a merit of mine. It is hardly
possible for someone with a minimal scientific and rational education to fall for
magical ideas, such as that our thoughts are the producers of our reality—but
I had that education by luck and not by merit. Is it my
accomplishment to have had a father that procured to instruct me in
philosophy and science, or her fault to have lacked or forgotten that very same
instruction? I am a lot of things, but not confused—and yet, are my tranquility and
determination a merit of my own? I doubt it, insofar as I have been very lost
as well, when so was the will of fortune, and thus the matter seems at least in
great part to lay out of my hands. Even the differences in personality, which I
do consider relevant—she is more naive than I, for example, as accounted for
her unwillingness to admit that "feminist economy" is a pyramid
scheme—are, I suspect, much less in our control than we want to think.
Heraclitus taught: *character is fait*. This seems to me a pure
truism—in a non-pejorative way—.

What, then, is there to laugh about? If anything, I see a poor girl being robbed
off by scammers. Is she doing any harm to anybody? I see no reason to think so.
Is there an ethical dimension to her naivety, her magical ideas, her silliness?
If there is, then whatever harm is being done is done against her. A lost soul,
perhaps. But that is anybody's faith. And this is all I came to think when
thinking of her.
