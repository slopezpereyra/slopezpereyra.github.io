Three riverine cats were witness, nothing more,<br>
of our obscure affair. The river still<br>
repeats the words we whispered on the shore,<br>
without a doubt against the river's will.<br>
I hear the wicked waters ask: ---What for?<br>
Why did those feet offend the coast? To kill?<br>
To perjure and corrupt? Or to restore <br>
something we took and offered to the nil...<br>
Only the waters know that day I learned<br>
that afterglows could wane in human eyes<br> 
like purple ink that's bleeding in a pond.<br> 
Only the waters now remain concerned,<br> 
while we try to forget or to disguise.<br>
Only the water speaks---we won't respond.
