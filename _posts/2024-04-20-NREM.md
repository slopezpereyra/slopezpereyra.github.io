## NREM Periods

An electroencephalography (EEG) is typically staged in 30 second epochs. A NREM
period is defined as any sequence of epochs satisfying the following
conditions:

- the sequence contains only NREM stages (stages $2$, $3$ or $4$);
- the total amount of NREM sleep in the sequence is $15$ minutes or more;
- the sequence is ended by either $a.$ 5 minutes or more of REM or $b.$ $5$
  minutes or more of wakefulness. 

Importantly, when parsing for a NREM period, the sequence may contain stages
that aren't NREM stages. But these should be ignored unless they last for five
minutes or more---i.e. unless they qualify as potential ending sequences for a
NREM period. (If curious about where this definition comes from, see [Feinberg
& Floyed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/220659/) or study Dijk's papers.)

For example, assume we find 5 minutes of stage 2, followed by 3 minutes of REM,
followed by 10 minutes of stage 3, followed by 10 minutes of REM or wake. Then
the epochs in the 5 minutes of stage 2 and the 10 minutes of stage 3 must be
marked as comprising a NREM period, ignoring the three minutes of REM in
between.

## Algorithm

I here provide an algorithm to automatically detect NREM periods. The algorithm
must take a sequence of stages $s_1, \ldots, s_n$, where $s_i$ the sleep stage
of the $i$th epoch, and output a sequence of $k$ vectors $\varrho_1, \ldots,
\varrho_k$. Each $\varrho_i = (\varrho_i^1, \ldots, \varrho_i^z)$ must be s.t.
$\varrho_{i}^{j}$ is the $j$th epoch in the $i$th NREM period. 

From the specification above, it follows that the algorithm finds the number of NREM periods (i.e. $k$) and the epochs which comprise them. Thus, it provides a complete characterization of NREM periods during a night of sleep.

#### Formalization

Let $n$ be the number of epochs corresponding to $15$ minutes and $m$ the
number of epochs corresponding to $5$ minutes. (In 30 second epochs, $n = 30, m
= 10$). 

Let $\Sigma =\\{1,
\ldots, 6, ?\\}$, with $5$ marking REM, $6$ wakefulness, $?$ unknown/unstaged. The algorithm works by mapping $\vec{s}$ to $\alpha = s_1 \ldots s_q$ a word over $\Sigma^*$.

Now, $[(5+6)^*(2+3+4)^*]^* \subset \Sigma^*$ is partitioned into $U$ and
$U’$, where $U$ is the set of words containing at least $n$ symbols $2, 3,
4$ where neither $5$ nor $6$ occur consecutively $m$ times. Then $\alpha$ can be decomposed into 

$$\alpha = \psi_1 \phi_1 \psi_2 \phi_2 \ldots \psi_k \phi_k \psi_{k+1}$$

where $\phi_i = \varphi_i (5^m5^* + 6^m6^*)$ and $\varphi_i \in U$.
Such a decomposition readily provides the number of NREM periods in the EEG
(i.e. ``k``). Furthermore, the epochs which comprise these periods are easily
inferable from the decomposition.

#### Implementation

In order to obtain the decomposition

$$\alpha = \psi_1 \phi_1 \psi_2 \phi_2 \ldots \psi_k \phi_k \psi_{k+1}$$

some intermediate steps are necessary. In particular, $s_1 \ldots s_q \in \Sigma^*$ is mapped into a simpler alphabet $\Sigma' = \\{X, I, 5, 6\\}$, where $I$ are symbols that can be safely ingnored during parsing. The parts of the word that must not be ignored are deduced from the definition of NREM period. Then, the regular expression (in Julia)

```julia
ζ = Regex("(?:[X](I*)){$n,}(?:[5](I*){$m,}|6{$m,}|\$)")
```

provides the $\alpha$ decomposition given above by matching every $\phi_j$.

This functions separates repeating characters in a string into different words.
Example: '1122144434444556' ↦ '11 22 1 444 3 44444 55 6'

This is necessary because repeating REM or wake of certain length mark the 
end of NREM periods. Thus, from this separation we can infer which parts of 
the word are functionally releant and which can be ignored.
