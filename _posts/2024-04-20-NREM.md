# Introduction

I here provide an algorithm to automatically detect NREM periods given a
sequence of sleep stages. I developed this algorithm at the laboratory to
facilitate a tedious process. Finding its use of formal language theory
interesting, I decided it to make it public. The problem at hand is as follows.

Given sleep stages $s_1, \ldots, s_n$, where $s_i$ the sleep stage of the $i$th
epoch in a night of sleep, we wish to detect $(a)$ which of these epochs
corresponds to a NREM period and, if possible, $(b)$ how many such periods
exist. A bit more formally, given such sequence, we wish to produce a sequence
of $k$ vectors $\varrho_1, \ldots, \varrho_k$, such that if $\varrho_i =
(\varrho_i^1, \ldots, \varrho_i^z)$, then $\varrho_{i}^{j}$ is the $j$th epoch
in the $i$th NREM period. 

Such output would readily satisfy points $(a)$ and $(b)$, and thus provide a
complete characterization of the NREM periods in a night of sleep.

Of course, whatever semantic such algorithm could have depends entirely on that
of *NREM period*. In other words, a satisfactory definition of NREM period must
be provided. We follow one that is standard in sleep science, provided by
[Feinberg & Floyed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/220659/) and also discussed
extensively in the work of Dijk. Namely, we say a sequence of sleep stages 
corresponds to a NREM period if and only if:

- The sequence contains subsequences of NREM stages not interrupted by more
than $5$ minutes of other stages (including wakefulness).
- The total amount of NREM sleep in the sequence is $15$ minutes or more.
- The sequence is terminated by either $a.$ 5 minutes or more of REM or $b.$
$5$ minutes or more of wakefulness. 


As the reader may see, the sequence of NREM stages is not required to be
continuous. In other words, between any two stages in a NREM period there may
be stages which do not correspond to NREM sleep. These should be ignored unless
they last for five minutes or more-i.e. unless they qualify as terminating 
sequences, as specified in the items above. 

A special consideration is that, for the first and last NREM periods in a night
of sleep, the restriction that terminating sequences last $\geq 5$ minutes is
not imposed - i.e. a single REM or wake stage is considered to terminate the
period. This small caveat is not considered in the formal algorithm presented
below, so as to keep it general, but is trivial to make it effective in a
practical implementation - as it actually is in the implementation I refer to
at the end of this entry.

# The algorithm

We define a sleep stage as an element of the alphabet $\Sigma = \\{ 1, \ldots,
6 \\}$. We understand $1, \ldots, 4$ as the usual stages, $5$ as REM and $6$ as
wakefulness. Let $n, m \in \mathbb{N}$ be parameters in our algorithm, with $n$ specifying
the number of epochs which make up for $15$ minutes and $m$ the number which
makes up for $5$ minutes.

Let $\mathcal{L} = [(5+6)^* (2+3+4)^* ]^* \subseteq \Sigma^*$. Define
$\mathcal{L}'\subseteq \mathcal{L}$ as the set of words containing at least $n$
symbols in $\{ 2, 3, 4 \}$ and s.t. no other symbols occur repeatedly $m$ or
more times. Trivially, $\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}' \cup
\overline{\mathcal{L}'}$; i.e. $\mathcal{L}'$ induces a trivial partition of
$\mathcal{L}$.

Then $\alpha = s_1 \ldots s_r$, with $s_i \in \Sigma$, can be subjected to the
following decomposition:

$$\alpha = \psi_1 \phi_1 \psi_2 \phi_2 \ldots \psi_k \phi_k \psi_{k+1}$$

where $\phi_i = \varphi_i (5^m5^* + 6^m6^*)$ and $\varphi_i \in \mathcal{L}$.
Such a decomposition readily provides the number of NREM periods in the EEG
(i.e. $k$).  

This decomposition of $\alpha$ inspires the following effective procedure:


- In $s$, replace the occurrences of $1$ with $0$ and the occurrences 
        of $2, 3, 4$ with $1$.
- Let $\omega_1, \ldots, \omega_r$ be the sub-words of $s$ which
        consist of repeated symbols.
- For each $\omega_1, \ldots, \omega_r$, if $0$ or $1$ occur 
        in $\omega$ do nothing; if $|\omega| \geq m$ do nothing; 
        otherwise, replace $\omega$ with $0^{|\omega|}$.
- Output $\omega := \omega_1 \ldots \omega_r$

An example of each step of this procedure with $m = 3$ over the word
$123331166555$ is

$$
123331166555 \to 011110066555 \to 0 ~ 1111~ 00 ~ 66~ 555 \to 0 ~1111~ 00~ 00~ 555
$$

and the output would be $011110000555$. Hopefully, we see how the
transformation reveals important information about NREM sleep, insofar as the
$1$s correspond to periods of NREM stages, the $0$s to stages which should be
ignored, and sequences of $5$ or $6$ (of length $\geq m$) to sequences which
mark the end of a NREM period.

It is trivial to observe that the transformation $g$ is $O(n)$, since it can be
done with a a series of iterations over the characters of $s_1 \ldots s_r$.

A specific implementation of this algorithm, in the Julia language, is provided
in my [EEG Toolkit](https://slopezpereyra.github.io/EEGToolkit.jl/dev/) package
for EEG analysis.
