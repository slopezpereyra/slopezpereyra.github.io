title: An application of formal language theory to the detection of NREM sleep
categories: [ Science ]
---

The title of this entry is more promising than its content. It is usual to
define NREM periods as any succession of epochs from a sleep EEG satisfying the
following two conditions:


- It starts with at least 15 minutes of stages 2, 3 or 4.
- It ends with either $a.$ at least 5 minutes of REM or $b.$ wakefulness. 


(See, for instance, [Feinberg &
Floyed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/220659/) or search for papers by Dijk.)

There are a few programs that, given a sequence of stages $s_1, \ldots, s_n$, with $s_i$ the sleep stage of
the $i$th epoch, automatically find NREM periods.

The naïve approach to this problem is to iterate over the sequence with 
an appropriate set of `if` statements and so on. But this is cumbersome and 
silly. If one defines NREM periods as words within a general formal language,
the problem of detecting these periods becomes trivial to the point that 
it can be done in less than five lines of code.

Let $\Sigma = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ an alphabet where $1, \ldots, 4$ denote the
homonimous sleep stages, $5$ denotes REM and $6$ denotes wakefulness. Then the
succession $s_1, \ldots, s_n$ may be treated as a word $\alpha \in \Sigma^{*}$
of the form 

$$
\alpha = \psi_1 \beta_1 \psi_2 \beta_2 \ldots \psi_k\beta_k \psi_{k+1}
$$

where $\psi_i$ is an arbitrary word and

$$
\beta_i = \varphi (5^M5^* | 6)
$$

with $\varphi \in \\{ w \in \{2, 3, 4\}^+ : |w| \geq N \\}$, $N$ the minimum
duration imposed for NREM periods, $M$ the minimum duration imposed for ending
REM periods. Thus, the problem of finding the $k$ underlying NREM periods 
in a series of sleep stages becomes the problem of finding the $k$ substrings
$\beta_1, \ldots, \beta_k$ of $\alpha$. This problem is trivial from an 
implementation perspective, since programming languages include regular expressions 
natively.


Subtleties, such as not imposing a minimum duration to the ending REM period 
of the first NREM period, can easily be adapted into the regular expression of each $\beta_i$.

For example, in Julia, 

```julia 
function nrem(staging::Vector, n::Integer, m::Integer)
    """
    nrem(eeg::EEG, n::Integer, m::Integer)

    This function finds all NREM periods in a stage vector. It returns a list [ [a₁, b₁], …, [aₖ, bₖ] ] s.t. 
    each of the k NREM periods of the EEG range between epochs [aᵢ, bᵢ], i ∈ ℕ.

    Given a sequence s₁, …, sₖ of sleep stages, s.t. sᵢ is the stage of the ith epoch in an EEG,
    we define the alphabet Σ = {s : s ∈ {s₁, …, sₙ})}. We assume Σ = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, with 5 denoting 
    REM and 6 denoting wakefulness. If α = s₁… sₙ ∈ Σ*, we assume α can be decomposed into the form 

                                α = ψ₁β₁ …  ψₖβₖ ψₖ₊₁ 

    where ψᵢ is an arbitrary word and βᵢ is a word of the form 

                                φ(5ᵐ5* + 6),   φ ∈ { w ∈ {2, 3, 4}* : |w| ≥ n }

    Here, n is the minimum length imposed upon combinations of stages 2, 3, and 4, in order to account for a NREM period,
    while m is the minimum length imposed upon REM periods terminating NREM periods.

    Thus, βᵢ can be thought of as a NREM period, and the set φ(5ᵐ5* + 6) as the universe of NREM periods.
    """
    φ = Regex("[234]{$n,}(?:6|5{$(m+1),})")
    α = join(staging, "")
    matches = eachmatch(φ, α)
    return [ [match.offset, match.offset + length(match.match)] for match in matches ]
end
