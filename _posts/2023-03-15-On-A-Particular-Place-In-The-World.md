#### On a particular place in the world

There is no awe in myths —in their existence, I mean. To a meaning-yearning
value-encoding animal there opposes a world of vernal ravines and winter snows
and stars. A peculiar place exists in northern Russia, an island by the name of
*Novaya Zemlya*. There Gerrit de Veer saw a sun unlike the sun, a sun contriving
a horizontal flame, a sun even more limber and majestic than the sun. He was
the first at that as well. The effect is named after the place, the *Novaya
Zemlya effect*. He was the first at many things —as all men are. The first
documented case of hypervitaminosis A is in his diaries —an unfortunate voyager
that ate the liver of a polar bear somewhere amid the ice. 

Surely everything is still and quiet at Novaya Zemlya, surely there everything
shirks its existential duty and awaits malingering or slumbering final
disintegration. And yet it seems to me nothing is ragged there nor gaunt nor
shabby, all must be new and renewed at every instant. I am surely
romanticizing. The soviets used the site to test their nuclear arsenal, which
contests my pristine idealization. Perhaps everything is dead at Novaya Zemlya,
and will persist on its death till all is done, till no more a sun unlike the
sun grows to the grieving sky, all gone never to rise or live again. I cannot
know. I can only claim this: things exist that prove there is no awe in myths
—in their existence, I mean. And that was surely felt by Gerrit de Veer, the
voyager.
