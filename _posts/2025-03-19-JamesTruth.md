title: A short comment on W. James theory of truth
categories: [Philosophy, Personal]

In the second conference which comprises William James' *Pragmatism*, he
explains why this philosophy does not *in principle* entail a preference for
materialism over idealism, "no such materialism bias as ordinary empiricsm
labors under". He writes:

> If theological ideas prove to have a value for concrete life, they will be
> true, for pragmatism, in the sense of being good for so much. For how much
> more they are true, will depend entirely on their relations to other truths
> that also have to be acknowledged.

The Absolute of transcendental idealism *performs a concrete function*, insofar
as its believers draw practical consequences or guides to action from it. He
emphasizes these consequences are *good*, and insofar has they are *good*, he
writes, who could deny the truth of the Absolute?

Truth, James' says, is "a species of good", not a category distinct from it.
"True is the name of whatever proves itself to be good in the way of belief".
"What would be better for us to believe" is proposed as a candidate definition
for *truth*. Something is true if it "fits every part of life best and combines
with the collectivity of experience's demands (...)".

There is a special kind of relativism here, one which is not only different
from traditional epistemological relativism (truth does not truly exist
independently from a subject's perspective) but which in fact contradicts it
entirely. It is of course conceivable that an idea $\lambda$ may be consistent
and fruitful within the 'system' of person $A$ while being inconsistent or
unfruitful within the 'system' of person $B$. (By a person's 'system' I mean
here the factors which James' deems important in the formation of belief: the
pre-existing collection of ideas the individual has and the demands which
experience imposes upon them.) So far nothing problematic exists: in logics, for
instance, $(a)$ different sets of axioms or $(b)$ different models may associate
to a given formula $\varphi$ a different value, and the semantic of $\varphi$ is
undefined except with regards to any such set or model. 

How could we determine the truth value of a sentence such as "$B$ is wrong in
believing $lambda$"? If we follow James' theory, such question could only be
resolved through reference to $B$'s believes, actions and experiences, and the
sentence *does not imply* "$A$ is wrong in believing $\lambda$". This seems to
entail the phrases "$\lambda$ is false" and $\lambda$ is true" lack any meaning,
insofar as they lack reference to a subject. This issue is only solved when
$\lambda$ is an idea which cannot, under any circumstance, be fruitful,
productive or coherent. Though there aren't many such ideas, epistemological
relativism is one. 

The fundamental issue with epistemological relativism, as well as with
scepticism, is that it is strictly academic. Everybody acts as if some things
were certainly true and some things were certainly false. The most radical
relativist has rather strict notions of true and false, as well as of right and
wrong, when he takes his char to the mechanic or goes to the hospital to mend a
wound or treat an illness. Furthermore, the relativist or the sceptic do not
fail to act as if their believes were true due to hypocrisy or lack of
consequence: they fail to act in accordance to their philosophies because doing
so is contrary to life itself. If any given species, at some point in natural
history, was not hard-wired to act as if certain things were *facts*; if a
predetermined universe of truths was not embedded in their brains and expanded
through experience, Darwinian evolution has surely erased every trace of it. For
what kind of existence can endure without action? And what is belief but rule
for action?

But I digress. We must accept *at least* that we act as if things were true, and
thus land again on questions arising from James' theory. Any theory of truth
which does not lead from "$A$ is right in believing $\lambda$" to "$B$ is wrong
in not believing $\lambda$" is problematic. The fact that a subset of ideas is
saved does not reduce the problem. Could one say Galileo and Bruno were wrong in
their beliefs? Such beliefs were $(a)$ certainly inconsistent with facts as
recognized in their times (this was accurately pointed out in Feyerabend's
*Against method*) and $(b)$ pernicious to their life. Are the flames which
extinguished Bruno's life a refutation of his theses? 

Many examples such as these one come to mind. James' theory of truth is
unsatisfactory. Necessary reference to both a subject and a certain (rather
undefined) kind of utility makes reasonable debate almost impossible.
