# Advanced Caro-Kann 

## Short variation

In the *Short variation* of the advanced Caro-Kann, White plays the seemingly
quiet 5.Be2. Curiously, White's argument is that he needs no special arguments!
White claims Black's self-induced slow development and tempo-lag is sufficient
to claim superiority, and nothing special is needed on his end. The line has
some sharp and interesting variations. 

### Short variation: Main line

Here, White has many interesting options. We will begin with the sharper ones. 

The first variation we will examine is what happens if White plays 8.Bg5!?. This
idea carries two positional threats. $(a)$ When pinning the e7 knight, White
hinders the liberation of the f8 bishop, making d6 weak. A slow reply like Bg6?
would be met by Nb5! and it is impossible to prevent White's knight from
penetrating. $(b)$ Secondly, the move prevents normal development (e.g. Nbc6)
due to the threat of Nxf5. The pin on the e7 knight would force Black to reply
exf5 and enter the middlegame with a weak structure.

Having understood those threats, it's clear that Black must unpin with tempo, 
so as to continue with development normally.

After 8...Qa5+ 9.Nc3 (other replies are harmless) Nbc6, White has two critical
ways to continue. The stubborn one is to insist on getting a knight on d6 via 
Ndb5, while the other is to play Bb5. 

After 10.Nb5!?, 10...Ng6 is pretty much forced, which leads to tactical
complications because now Black's LSB lacks retreat squares and therefore g4 is
lurking. 

>  The immediate 11.g4 would not be possible because the e4 square is available
>  for the bishop, and f3 would be met with d4, a sharp pawn sacrifice which gives
>  Black a lot of activity.

Thus, White always plays 11.a3 threatening b4, but leading to nothing conclusive
after 11...Be7 12.Bxe7 Kxe7! 13.b4 Qd8 14.Nd6 with a very interesting position.

Tactically, a property of the position is the overloaded e6-pawn, which prevents
Black from immediately playing 14...Ngxe5? due to 15.Nxf5 exf5 16.Qxd5 and Black
loses a pawn, has the inferior structure, and the unsafe king (+-). But it is
essential to capture on e5 and weaken White's strong knight, so Black must play
14...d4! to release the pressure on d5. After 15.Nb5 Ngxe5 the position is
equal, but White's knights will dominate and the b7 pawn will most likely fall.
I think White has good winning chances.

White's most common reply, however, is 10.Bb5, which poses a threat but is far
less complicated.

The threat clearly is 11.Bxe7, leaving the Nc6 unsufficiently defended. But
after 11...Qc7 White has nothing better than castling, and Black can continue
with the usual Bg6 Nf5 Be7 and castling. Perhaps White can try 12.Qg4!? with the
idea of h4-h5 and kingside aggression. The key is that Black must play a6 and,
if White responds Ba4, play h5 himself!
