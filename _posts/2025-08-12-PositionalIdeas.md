# Advanced Caro-Kann 

## Short variation

In the *Short variation* of the advanced Caro-Kann, White plays the seemingly
quiet 5.Be2. Curiously, White's argument is that he needs no special arguments!
White claims Black's self-induced slow development and tempo-lag is sufficient
to claim superiority, and nothing special is needed on his end. The line has
some sharp and interesting variations. 

### Short variation: Main line

Here, White has many interesting options. We will begin with the sharper ones. 

The first variation we will examine is what happens if White plays 8.Bg5!?. It
is imperative that Black unpins with tempo via Qa5+ and then continues
development normally via Nc6.

Here the two critical lines are Bb5 and Ndb5, insofar as any other continuation
allows Black to materialize the liberating trade on d4 followed by Nc6, Be7 and
castles.

The idea oaf 10.Nb5!?a is simple: to exploit the outpost on d6. 10...Ng6 is pretty
much forced, which leads to tactical complications because now Black's LSB lacks
retreat squares and therefore g4 is lurking. 

>  The immediate 11.g4 would not be possible because the e4 square is available
>  for the bishop, and f3 would be met with d4, a sharp pawn sacrifice which gives
>  Black a lot of activity.

Thus, White always plays 11.a3 threatening b4, but leading to nothing conclusive
after 11...Be7 12.Bxe7 Kxe7! 13.b4 Qd8 14.Nd6 with a very interesting position:

Tactically, a property of the position is the overload on the e6-pawn, which
prevents Black from immediately playing 14...Ngxe5? due to 15.Nxf5 exf5 16.Qxd5
and Black loses a pawn, has the inferior structure, and the unsafe king (+-).
But it is essential to capture on e5 and weaken White's strong knight, so Black
must play 14...d4! to release the pressure on d5. After 15.Nb5 Ngxe5 the
position is equal, but White's knights will dominate and the b7 pawn will most
likely fall.
