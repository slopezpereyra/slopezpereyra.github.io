Positional analysis consists in the answering of three questions: $(a)$ what are
the weaknesses of each side, actual or potential; $(b)$ what is the worst piece
of each side, and $(c)$ what does our opponent intend. 

Consider the following position:


<div markdown="0">
{% raw %}

{% endraw %}
</div>

Positional analysis might go as follows:

$(a)$ White's only weaknesses are the queenside darksquares, particularly c3.
The e4 square is also weak, at least insofar as f3 is illegal now and probably
undesirable anyway. Black's weaknesses are the e6, a3 and b5 pawns, the latter
of which will remain a weakness if pushed to b4 (though strengthening a3).
Another weaknesses for Black are the e5 and c5 squares, and in general all dark
squares.

$(b)$ White's worst piece is the light-squared bishop at g2, which does not
contribute to the positional dispute around Black's weak dark squares, with the 
a1 rook following. Black's worst piece is the c8 bishop.

$(c)$ Black would like to play Ne4 and b4, with the idea of Nc3 and Ba6, in
which case he will be probably better. White would like to play Bg5 to prevent
Ne4, but it's Black to move so that's out of the question and Nd4 is a reality.
So White's plan should therefore consist of Bd2, overprotecting c3, followed by
Rfc1. (Better Rfc1 than Rac1 since after Black's inevitable plan of b4-Ba6, the
e-pawn would be pinned.)

Now assume that after a few moves, the position has transformed into the one
below.


<div markdown="0">

Apparently, Black missed the opportunity of playing Ne4 and allowed Bg5 followed
by Bxf6. He has succeeded however in trading his LSB by one of White's knights. 

$(a)$ White still has weak queenside dark squares, particularly a weak c3
square, which is in the potential reach of the knight. The a2 pawn is a
potential weakness. Black still has a weak e6 pawn. The e5 weakness is gone but
now the f6 pawn is weak. c5 is weak.

$(b)$ White's worse piece is now the f3 knight, which has no good squares to go
to. Black's worst piece is d6 bishop, whose only passive role is the defense of
b4. 

$(c)$ White's plan should consist of improving his knight via Ne1-Nd3 whereon
the knight can reach c5 or f4. So the expected moves are Qe2 (keeping an eye on
b5) or Qd2, Ne1-Nd3 followed perhaps by doubling rooks. Black's plans should consist of
getting his knight to c3 via Ne8-Nd6-Ne4, where White must either allow the
knight in or commit to f3.
