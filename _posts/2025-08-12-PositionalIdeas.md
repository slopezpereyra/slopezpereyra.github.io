### 8.Bg5 e5?! variation 

The move 8...e5?! by Black, after 9.Qd3, leads to the following position.

I consider Black's eigth move dubious because it leads to very passive play and
gives White a natural plan. Most games continue 9...Be7 10.Bxf6 Bxf6 11.O-O-O,
leading to the following position.

This position merits a discussion, since finidng the correct idea for Black is
not easy OTB. The d6 pawn is hanging and the natural response Be7 by Black leads
to passivity. Instead, Black should play Qb6?! with pressure on f2. After Qe2 by
White, the pawn is still hanging and Black must decide whether to play Qc5 or
Be7. In both cases, White's plan is the typical Chekhover maneuver of Nd2
followed by either Nb3 or Nc4, depending on what Black plays.
