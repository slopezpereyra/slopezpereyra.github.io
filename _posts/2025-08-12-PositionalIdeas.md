# Classical Caro-Kann

The classical Caro-Kann has the following starting position.

Though the "propperly" classical variation occurs after 5.Ng3 Bg6, we will
consider one early sidelines before delving into that. I mean the interesting
5..Nc5!?.

The move is somewhat unprincipled but has been tested out by high-caliber
players such as Carlsen, Ivanchuk, Radjabov, and Svidler. Superficially, the
idea is the same as the more typical 5.Ng3: to move the knight to safety with
tempo (the b7 pawn is hanging). However, Black can equalize relatively quickly
with an early e5 break, exploiting the fact that the d-pawn is overloaded.

After 5...e5!? 6.Nxb7 Qb6 7.Nc5 exd4 8.Nb3, the pressure on the d-pawn is
released with 8...Bb4+ and Black faces essentially no problems, leading in
development and central control.

If White tries 8.Na4 instead of 8.Nb3, attacking the queen instead of the pawn,
the simple 8...Qa5+ 9.c3 dxc3 10.Nxc3 Bb4 leads to standard play. 

Having said that, we now turn to consider the typical setup occurring after
5.Ng3 Bg6. Though White's main response here is 6.h4, seeking kingside
expansion, a few sidelines are worth considering: 6.f4, 6.Nf3 and 6.Bc4.  

The position after 6.f4 is seen below.

</div>

Of course, the idea is to get a strong grip of e5, playing for a bind *á la
Maróczy*. Black should aim for solid play, typically has no rush to castle,
and sets his pieces as seen below.

The knights on e7 and d7 support the bishop on g6, prevent potential f5 breaks,
and support the c5 break. Black's position has no weaknesses. Black will
eventually trade on d3 and get a pleasent game.

The 6.Nf3 variation is equally timid.

Black should respond with the typical Nd7, which prevents Ne5, and it is
possible to transpose to the main 6.h4 line within a few moves. This line is
very drawish and deserves little comment.

The last sideline we will consider is the move 6.Bc4!?, which after 7.N1e2 might
be followed by $(a)$ castling, $(b)$ h4 or the mainline $(c)$ Nf4.

</div>

The idea of this setup is to play for the f5 break, which justifies Bc4 and
N1e2. If White plays 8.O-O it is imperative to know the refutation, which
consists of transfering the knight on b8 to b6 via d7, forcing a trade of LSBs
(the bishop on b3 would be passive) and then playing g6 the crucial move g6.

If in this setup White feels adventurous and attempts f5 anyway, gxf5 should
give Black good play. The sacrifice Nxf5 complicates the position a lot, but
does not work because Black can achieve a good defensive setting after Be7-Nfd5,
even giving up the f7 pawn.

I believe this Bc4 line is a good attacking weapon for White, since Black must
play precisely in order to equalize. On the Lichess database, White won 62% (!)
of games after 9.f4.

The move 8.h4 makes little sense, since after 8...h6 Black's LSB has a retreat
square already, making Nf4 a weaker idea. So more worthy of consideration is the
immediate 8.Nf4. Of course, Black can never play h6 now, and the correct defense
is to exert pressure on the knight quickly via Bd6 and Qc7. As seen in the line,
this can lead to an early exchange of queens and a safe game for black.



# Advanced Caro-Kann 

## Short variation

In the *Short variation* of the advanced Caro-Kann, White plays the seemingly
quiet 5.Be2. Curiously, White's argument is that he needs no special arguments!
White claims Black's self-induced slow development and tempo-lag is sufficient
to claim superiority, and nothing special is needed on his end. The line has
some sharp and interesting variations. 

### Short variation: Main line


<div markdown="0">

{% endraw %}
</div>

Here, White has many interesting options. We will begin with the sharper ones. 

The first variation we will examine is what happens if White plays 8.Bg5!?. This
idea carries two positional threats. $(a)$ When pinning the e7 knight, White
hinders the liberation of the f8 bishop, making d6 weak. A slow reply like Bg6?
would be met by Nb5! and it is impossible to prevent White's knight from
penetrating. $(b)$ Secondly, the move prevents normal development (e.g. Nbc6)
due to the threat of Nxf5. The pin on the e7 knight would force Black to reply
exf5 and enter the middlegame with a weak structure.

Having understood those threats, it's clear that Black must unpin with tempo, 
so as to continue with development normally.

{% endraw %}
</div>

After 8...Qa5+ 9.Nc3 (other replies are harmless) Nbc6, White has two critical
ways to continue. The stubborn one is to insist on getting a knight on d6 via 
Ndb5, while the other is to play Bb5. 

After 10.Nb5!?, 10...Ng6 is pretty much forced, which leads to tactical
complications because now Black's LSB lacks retreat squares and therefore g4 is
lurking. 

>  The immediate 11.g4 would not be possible because the e4 square is available
>  for the bishop, and f3 would be met with d4, a sharp pawn sacrifice which gives
>  Black a lot of activity.

Thus, White always plays 11.a3 threatening b4, but leading to nothing conclusive
after 11...Be7 12.Bxe7 Kxe7! 13.b4 Qd8 14.Nd6 with a very interesting position.

Tactically, a property of the position is the overloaded e6-pawn, which prevents
Black from immediately playing 14...Ngxe5? due to 15.Nxf5 exf5 16.Qxd5 and Black
loses a pawn, has the inferior structure, and the unsafe king (+-). But it is
essential to capture on e5 and weaken White's strong knight, so Black must play
14...d4! to release the pressure on d5. After 15.Nb5 Ngxe5 the position is
equal, but White's knights will dominate and the b7 pawn will most likely fall.
I think White has good winning chances.

White's most common reply, however, is 10.Bb5, which poses a threat but is far
less complicated.

</div>

The threat clearly is 11.Bxe7, leaving the Nc6 unsufficiently defended. But
after 11...Qc7 White has nothing better than castling, and Black can continue
with the usual Bg6 Nf5 Be7 and castling. Perhaps White can try 12.Qg4!? with the
idea of h4-h5 and kingside aggression. The key is that Black must play a6 and,
if White responds Ba4, play h5 himself!
