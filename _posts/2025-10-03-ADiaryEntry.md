Years after a Raskolnikovian time, I have awoken as a man that looks upon the
endless sky and thinks: *This is a perfect world*. Years after I wrote how
longingly I wished to be a simple man, I have awoken as a man that stares in
perfect silence at the sky and thinks: *I am a quiet soul*. I used to dream
strange dreams, and doze under a secrete and obscure fever. Now in my dreams I
hold a simple, yet exacting desire: kindness, that supreme expression of the
love for life.
