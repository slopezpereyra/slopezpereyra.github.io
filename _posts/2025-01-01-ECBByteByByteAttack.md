Assume we have access to an encryption scheme which, given an input $\beta$,
encrypts $\alpha \beta \gamma$, where $\alpha, \gamma$ are unknown. Our task
is to decrypt the content of $\gamma$. Assume that we know that the length of
$\alpha$ is of at most 16-bytes.

If we knew the exact length $\ell$ of $\alpha$, then producing an input of length 
$31 - \ell$ would make the scheme encrypt 


$$
\alpha_1 \ldots \alpha_{\ell} \beta_1 \ldots \beta_{31 - \ell} \gamma_1 \gamma_2 \ldots
$$

where the second 16-byte block has as final byte $\gamma_1$. This would allow us to easily 
decrypt $\gamma_1$, with in turn would allow us to decrypt $\gamma_2$, and so on. So the 
question becomes how can we determine the length of $\alpha$.

Fortunately for us, this is quite simple. Simply let $\beta$ be an arbitrary
string of 16-bytes. If the length of $\alpha$ is zero, then the encryption
scheme would encrypt $\beta_1 \ldots \beta_{16} \gamma_1 \ldots \gamma_{16}
\gamma_{17} \ldots$. This means for any pair of 16-byte strings $\beta_1,
\beta_2$, the encryption of the first block would differ, but that of the
second block would remain the same.

If the length of $\alpha$ is 1, then choosing two 15-byte strings $\beta_1, \beta_2$ would 
again ensure that the encryption of the first block differs, but that of the second block remains the same.
This generalizes: if $|\alpha| = k$, then for any pair $\beta_1, \beta_2$ of length $16 - k$, we have:

- The encryption with input $\beta_1, \beta_2$ produces the same second block but different first blocks.
- The encryption with input $\beta_1', \beta_2'$ strings of length superior to $16 - k$ produces different 
first blocks and different second blocks.

Thus, it is quite easy to deduce $|alpha|$ with a for loop, given in pseudo-code below.

``` go
sizeOfAlpha(){
    for i := 16; i >= 0; i-- {
        aWord, bWord := repeat("A", 16 - i), repeat("B", 16 - i)
        aEncryption, bEncryption = encryption(aWord), encryption(bWord)
        if firstBlock(aEncryption) != firstBlock(bEncryption) && secBlock(aEncryption) == secBlock(bEncryption){
            return 16 - i
        }
    }
}
```

Having deduced the size of $\alpha$, we proceed with a byte-to-byte attack to
decrypt $\gamma$. The attack is simple: first, produce an input which ensures
that the last byte of the second block is the first (unknown) byte of $\gamma$.
This is easy to do knowing the length of $\alpha$. Thus, the second block is the 
encryption $\beta'\gamma_1$ where $\beta'$ is of length 15-bytes and is a tail of 
$\beta$. Then, encrypt with input $\beta'x$ iterating $x$ over all possible bytes,
until a byte matches the previous encryption. Such byte is $\gamma_1$.

The process is repeated: give an input $\beta'$ of length $15-bytes$, ensure the last
two encrypted bytes are $\gamma_1 \gamma_2$. Since $\gamma_1$ is known, encrypt 
with $\alpha'\gamma_1 x$, looping $x$ across all possible bytes until a match is found.
This repeats until the first block of $\gamma$ is known.

Importantly, when we compare the encryptions with input $\beta'$ and $\beta'
x$ (with $x$ a variable), we do not compare the whole encryption but only the
block upon which we are working. Since the first block of the encryption corresponds 
to $\alpha$ (plus the head of $\beta$), it is the second block of the
encryption the one that corresponds to the first block of $\gamma$.
Inductively, it is the $k+1$th block of the encryption the one that corresponds
to the $k$th block of $\gamma$.

With some simple omissions, this is some code in Golang which makes the decryption effective.
