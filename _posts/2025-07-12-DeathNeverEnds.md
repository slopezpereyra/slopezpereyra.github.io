title: Death repeats itself

I dreamt the purple afterglow of a tropical sky. Like those we used to see dying
the waters of the febrile Paraná. And in my dream I said: Surely this is the
river, and surely it is the sky, we used to see. I looked around: nobody was
there. Not even my shadow knew of the body which projected it. And this words were
written in my mind: «You've died again».

So many times I've seen you in my dreams, my sweet old friend, or came across
your photograph, or walking pass the school of infancy I recalled your face
pressed against the fence, your hair in disarray. And each of those times I felt
you died again.

Oh yes, death repeats itself. We, the living, are its tireless manufacturers.
You, the dead, its pure and raw material.
