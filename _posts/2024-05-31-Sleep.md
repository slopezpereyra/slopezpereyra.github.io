**1.** Computational or processing systems need stabilization mechanisms. 

**1.1.** I take this as obvious *at least* in biological processing systems.
Artificial processing systems (e.g. a digital computer) may not need such
stabilization mechanisms.

**1.2.** Because of **1** it is probable that sleep-like states evolve independently 
in different organisms and different periods in time.

**1.2.1.** The evolution and phylogenesis of sleep is hard to study. It is unclear how much 
sleep-like states in, for example, *C. elegans*, may contribute to the understanding of 
sleep in mammals. Perhaps not much?

**1.2.2** All mammals sleep, but the question "what is the simplest mammal that sleeps?" is not 
stimulating. Sleep seems to be very-well preserved. One might just stick with rats if curious 
about this.
