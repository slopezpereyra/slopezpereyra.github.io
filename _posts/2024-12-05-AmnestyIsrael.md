In a [detailed report](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde15/8668/2024/en/?fbclid=PAY2xjawG9-RRleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABpnxh9QGOMk1qJy1-Ua8Hvxpf9iAgI-4ShasKD4jzQX6bJOBsIGBZ0epr8w_aem_9_ChOdD3FhSTxzJe9XhxOg), Amnesty International (AI)
documented and summarized the crimes committed by 
Israel in its relentless destruction of Gaza. In particular,
it concluded Israel was guilty of:

- Killing members of the group 
- Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group 
- Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring
about its physical destruction in whole or in part

In particular, these crimes are committed with the "intent to destroy,
in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group (...)".
Thus, AI concluded that Israel's acts satisfy the Genocide Convention's
definition of the crime.
