Argentina's economy is in dire straits. [Unemployment has grown to pandemic
levels](https://buenosairesherald.com/economics/unemployment-in-argentina-rises-to-7-9-the-highest-in-four-years)
according to official reports (see also

But even so, Milei keeps accumulating electoral successes. His presidential
campaign went very well and now he has won the legislative elections in
astonishing fashion. I can think of only two factors two explain this: the
failure of Peronism, and the lowering of inflation. The latter is not
particularly strong, since the aforementioned economic contraction is the factor driving it.
Yes, lowering inflation is a stronger argument in favor of Milei's government
than an increase in GDP, since high inflation impacts violently and more heavily
on those who less have. But quite obviously, if no economic activity exists and
demand falls to starving levels, inflation will go down without improving life
conditions for anyone. 

Peronism, on the other hand, is such a complex phenomenon that I cannot even
begin to wrap my head around it, and I doubt anyone who claims to can. Peronism
is a pseudo-ideology and thus it is inherently indescribable in
non-anthropological terms. Originally, it was a right-wing, proto-fascist
movement, with an established track record of human right violations, censorship
and oppression. Yet the mixture of this violence with a welfare state, a blatant
yet appealing populism, and certain undeniable achievements (such as universal
healthcare and labor rights), made an indelible impression in the nation. From
then on Peronism evolved with hundreds of mutually contradicting expressions: a
communist *and* catholic guerrilla (?) in Montoneros, the fascist paramilitary
group AAA (which counted with Peron's approval), and the Kirchner's moderate
progressivism, all claim to themselves the name of *peronist*. It is the
underlying property which explains this chaos (in the sense in which Cicero used
the term, i.e. a state of total mixture and confusion) what I mean to express
when calling it pseudo-ideological. Less pedantically, I mean to say that
Peronism is about *power*, not about ideology: its alignment derives vertically
from leading figures, and policy making is carried out in *ad hoc* fashion.

Whatever the case, the last Peronist government was such a profound
disappointment to every day people, [who saw their economy
shattered](https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/economy/argentinas-inflation-hit-211-in-2023-fastest-gain-in-three-decades.phtml),
that the emergence of a pseudo-messianic element such as Milei's so-called
libertarianism was tremendously appealing. It is this, and not an economic
success, what explains Milei's electoral achievements. He is still in time to
claim that current issues are aftertastes of Peronism, a claim which is not
entirely true. Though disastrous in monetary terms, the last Peronist
administration did have some successes. It managed to [rebound industry
significantly](https://www.focus-economics.com/countries/argentina/#:~:text=17.5-,1.9)
after the COVID pandemic and economic activity within the sector showed a [real,
albeit non-uniform
increase](https://www.uia.org.ar/centro-de-estudios/4030/ceu-informe-industrial-no03-2023/).
Now, after libertarian deterioration, historical companies such as [Celulosa
Argentina](https://www.pulpapernews.com/20250903/16968/celulosa-argentina-files-bankruptcy-after-devastating-balance-sheet)
went bankrupt, [education funding is
squalid](https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/argentina/milei-vetoes-state-university-funding-bill-escalating-conflict-with-education-sector.phtml),
the health system is [in dire
straits](https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2025/argentines-reel-from-health-care-cutbacks-as-president-mileis-state-overhaul-mirrors-trumps/),
and science and research [were
destroyed](https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/argentina/mileis-chainsaw-slashes-funds-for-argentinas-science-and-research-institutes.phtml).

With regards to public spending on health, science and education, we are all
familiar with the following simplification: "the left" wants a big state with
huge spending, sometimes beyond its budget; "the right" wants a small state that
takes care only of the most essential. As most simplifications, this is false.
The common argument that science, education, and health are in dire straits
because the State *should not* or *cannot* support them financially is false, as
well as the claim that Milei's government aims at a small state. Milei has
drastically *increased* expenditure in [surveillance and
intelligence](https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/economy/milei-boosts-budget-of-argentinas-intelligence-services-by-73-billion-pesos.phtml)
and [plans to do the
same](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2024/08/22/javier-milei-is-splurging-on-the-army)
with the military. (See [this
entry](https://slopezpereyra.github.io/2024-12-10-2024Represion/) for a more
specific report.) Both Peronism and Milei's movement aim at a big and very
present state. They simply disagree on where its spending should go and what
aims its presence should seek to achieve. 

In any case, now that Milei has won the legislative elections, the worse is yet
to come. Argentina's economy will most likely continue to plunge and we will all
continue to see our neighbours, friends and lovers struggling to make ends meet.
Now I recall a year ago finding my neighbour, a pensioner, begging for food on
the street. I do not live in a poor neighbourhood. He had a fine apartment in a
fine place of the city. But [Milei's cuts to
pensions](https://www.dw.com/en/argentinas-austerity-cuts-drive-pensioners-onto-the-streets/g-74254531)
forced him to beg for bread. I think of him often, because he isn't a statistic:
I would often cross him in the street and say good morning. And I boil in
vengeful anger when I recall his hunger.
