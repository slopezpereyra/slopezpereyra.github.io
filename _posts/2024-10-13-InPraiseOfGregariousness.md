title: In praise of gregariousness

What makes a man dangerous is not the strength of his arms, but the
content of his heart. The weakest men, resented or enraged, poses more 
reason to worry than any gentle giant. The absolute inverse of this statement 
is also true: what makes beautiful a person is not the power, but the purity of
their thoughts. 

Gregariousness is a precious virtue. The world, with all its sorrows, is
filled with kind and beautiful people, some as simple and immediate as a flower,
some as complex and mysterious as an abyss or the moon. With the exception of
serious flaws—violence and wickedness are real—one need only practice a
radical acceptance of the other for their virtues to become almost instantly
apparent, and to learn how very much alike we all are. (If one is not willing
nor capable of practicing such acceptance, one has very little right to any
claim of justice, for the world is constantly accepting our many flaws.)

For instance, a few days ago I spent a sweet afternoon with a girl
with whom (so I believed) I shared very little. Whilst my childhood was
stable and comfortable, she was the daughter of an adolescent mother and a
criminal father who ended up going to jail. The city I was born, though far from
being a great city, is the capital of my province—she had been born in
the deepest interior of a neighboring province, which (on top of it all) she fled to
escape her father, winding up in the austral barrens of Usuahia. We could not
talk about politics—she wasn't interested—nor books or arts—she wasn't
learned—nor any of the things which I'd been taught, in my childhood, made a
person worth conversing with. 

All of this, to my fortune, left only place to talk about the content of
our hearts: of the struggles and joys which decorated the landscapes of
our minds. In that conversation, which perhaps was just a whisper, I saw
sparks of human kindness. I learned that we were ongoing rather similar
psychological processes; that, in all our differences, the sufferings which
plagued our families (and our minds) were not as different as first glances
gave away; that it wasn't an interest nor a passion what was bringing us
together, but something else indescribable and true. And in her kiss I felt I
was unsullied, freed from the hindrances which always set me apart from others.


I see it now: Aloofness is not a crown. If there is any such thing as wisdom in
this world, it must be this: that, at least *in potentia*, a perfect form of
kindness resides in every living thing. If one assumes this is true (and I
believe one must, even if only to find a reason a live), a simple imperative
arises: that one ought to strive to find it and, if possible, to nurture it in
oneself and others. It is not a revolution, but a world under such ethic is
superior to its alternative.
